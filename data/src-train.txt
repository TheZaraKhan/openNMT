  Our Beloved   submitted   My Lord   judge   between us   with truth and Our Lord is Ever   Merciful and He is the One Whose help is sought against the   heart   rending   words which     O disbelievers     you utter  
Does   this also   not guide and   enlighten   those who have inherited the earth   themselves   after   the destruction of   those   one time   dwelling in the earth that if We desire We may punish them   as well   for their sins and We shall seal their hearts   due to their evil behaviour   so they will be unable to hear   and understand the Truth    
O mankind   Indeed this Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   has come to you with the Truth from your Lord   So believe   in him   for your own good   But if you disbelieve   i   e   deny his Prophethood then bear in mind that He is Beyond Any Need of you because   whatever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah indeed   And Allah is All   Knowing   Most Wise  
And all of them are waiting for a single Mighty Blast   Shout   in which there will be no deferment  
Surely it is the most grievous sin in the sight of Allah  
But they who believe and do pious deeds   for them is an unending   everlasting   reward  
O Believers   Your   male and female   slaves and your children who have not yet attained puberty must seek your permission   to come to you   on three occasions     first   before Fajr   dawn   Prayer     second   when you put off your clothes at noon   for rest   and   third   after Isha   night   Prayer   when you go to bed for sleep   These are   the three   times   of privacy
Allah has not taken   to Himself   any son   nor is there any god with Him   In that case each god would certainly have taken   away   what he had created and they would surely have dominated each other   and the whole universe would have undergone violence and chaos     Glorified is Allah   above all that they describe  
Then We turned the victory over them to your favour and helped you with   affluence in   wealth and children and increased your numerical strength   as well    
And We   also   bestowed upon Lut   Lot   wisdom and knowledge and We delivered him from the town whose people practised filthy deeds   They were indeed a people with extremely evil   and   immoral character  
Say   Just tell me this   as well     If Allah prolongs the day over you till the Day of Judgment     then   what god is there besides Allah who will bring you night in which you may take rest   Do you not see  
It seems as if the lightning would snatch away their sight  
  O Beloved     Say   Never shall   anything   befall us but what Allah has prescribed for us   He alone is our Protector   And in Allah alone the believers should put their trust  
He who is an enemy to Allah   His angels   His Messengers and Gabriel and Michael   verily Allah   too   is an enemy to   these   disbelievers  
He   i   e   Khidr   said   No doubt   you will not be able to have patience being in my company  
  Allah   said   So   get you down from here   You have no way any right to show arrogance here   Away with you   from My Presence     You are certainly of the disgraced and humiliated lot  
So   that   waving fruit   laden garden   became a harvested field in the morning  
Then We raised them up to see which of the two groups would most rightly calculate   the time   that they stayed   in the cave    
Say   O mankind   I have   come   to all of you   as   the Messenger of Allah to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth   There is no God except He   He is the One Who grants life and causes death   So believe in Allah and His Messenger who is a Prophet   crowned with the glory of being   al   Ummi   i   e   he has not learnt anything from anyone except Allah but kn
Indeed   those who call themselves   the Muslims   the Jews   the Sabeans   worshippers of stars   and the Christians   all who believe   true   heartedly in accordance with the teachings of Muhammad   blessings and peace be upon him     in Allah and the Last Day   and practise piety steadfastly shall have neither any fear nor grief  
O Believers   Do not devour one anothers wealth unlawfully among yourselves unless it is a trade by your mutual agreement and do not kill yourselves   Surely   Allah is Kind to you  
They said   By Allah   indeed you know well we have not come   here to commit some crime   and create mischief in the land   nor are we thieves  
O Believers   Be helpers of Allah as Isa son of Maryam   Jesus son of Mary   said to   his   disciples   Who are my helpers towards   the path of   Allah   The disciples said   We are Allahs helpers   So a party of the Children of Israel believed and a party disbelieved   So We helped the believers against their enemies and they gained the upper hand  
And get two witnesses out of your own men   But if two men are not available then a man and two women     they   should be from among those whom you like as witnesses   i   e   consider trustworthy     so that if either of the two women forgets   the other may remind her  
Those who believe and do pious works   for them there are pleasures and rejoicing and excellent abode   in the Hereafter    
O Children of Yaqub   Jacob     Recall those favours that I bestowed upon you and that I exalted you above all the people   of your age    
And with him two young men also entered the prison   One of them said   I have seen myself   in a dream   pressing wine   from grapes     And the other said   I have seen myself   in a dream   that I am carrying bread on my head   with birds picking at it   O Yusuf   Joseph     Tell us its interpretation   Surely   we see you one of the spirituality excellent  
Yusuf   Joseph   said     If you really want me to accomplish some special assignment   then   appoint me as   a minister and trustee of   the treasures in the land   of Egypt     Indeed I am well versed in resource management and resource protection and an expert   in financial management    
O Believers   Do not live on usury doubled and redoubled and keep fearing Allah so that you may prosper  
And   likewise We sent   Lut     Lot   as well   when he said to his people   Do you perpetrate   such   lasciviousness as no people in the world have attempted before you  
And obstinately persisted in great sin   of denying Allah and setting up partners with Him    
  It will be said to them     Were My Revelations not repeatedly recited to you   and then you used to belie them  
This is revealed by Almighty   Ever   Merciful  
And the requital of an evil is the like of that evil   Then he who forgives and   by forgiving   reforms   his reward is with Allah   Verily   He does not make friends with the wrongdoers  
Do they have the treasures of the Mercy of your Lord   Who is Almighty   the Most Benevolent  
Have they any   such   partners who have established for them a path of Din   Religion   about which Allah has not given any Command   And had the Command of Judgment not   gone forth   already   the matter between them would have been settled   And surely there is a painful torment for the wrongdoers  
Forbidden to you is carrion   the animal that dies and is not slaughtered according to Islamic Law   and   the discharged   blood and pork and that   animal   on which the name of someone other than Allah has been invoked while slaughtering   and   the animal   that dies by strangling or by a violent blow   not by any sharp instrument   or by falling from a height or the one that 
  Musa   Moses     said   Never   Surely my Lord is with me   He will show me the way   to deliverance   just now  
And if you ask them   Who has created the heavens and the earth   they will certainly say   The Almighty   All   Knowing   Lord   has created them  
Nay   Allah is your Maula   Helper and Guardian   and He is the best of helpers  
And Allah has created for you spouses from among yourselves   and has created through your mates   wives   sons and grandsons and provided you with pure sustenance   Do they still believe in falsehood   abandoning the Truth   and disregard Allahs favours  
And do not   also   go near the orphans property but in a way that is beneficial   to the orphan   until he reaches his maturity   And do fulfil the promise   No doubt the promise will be questioned about  
Do they have   the knowledge of   the unseen that they write down  
He   Allah   to Whom belongs the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth   and Who has not taken   to Himself   any children   nor has He any partner in His Kingdom and He alone has created everything   and then destined   i   e   formatted   it exactly according to a definite estimation   its features   functions   time frame and everything for all the stages of its growth and s
It is they who have purchased the worldly life for the Hereafter   So neither will their torment be lessened nor will they be helped  
So when He conferred on them   wealth   out of His Bounty   they became miserly with it and turned back retracting from   their promise    
And when the heavenly universe will be split open  
For those who accept the Command of their Lord is the excellent outcome   And those who reject His Command   even though they possess all that is in the earth and the like of it added to that   and they atone it   to be delivered from torment   even then   they are the ones whose accountability will be horrible   And Hell is their abode   and that is a wretched abode  
And verily your Lord alone is Almighty   Ever   Merciful  
Well   What do you think of the Lord of all the worlds  
And if Allah were to expand sustenance for all His servants abundantly   they would surely transgress and revolt in the earth   But He sends down as He pleases according to the measure   of needs     Surely He is Best Aware of His servants   needs     All   Seeing  
Yet you turned back after this   promise and warning     So   had there not been Allahs Bounty and His Mercy upon you   you would have been wrecked indeed  
His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth   He is the One Who gives life and causes death   and He wields Absolute Power over everything  
So he whose scales of deeds in the balance will be heavy  
Ruined are those who tell lies out of assumption and conjecture  
And We sent him towards   the people of Nineveh on the land of Mosul     a population of a hundred thousand or more  
Then when he saw the sun shining   he said   Is it my Lord   in your view because   this is the biggest   But when that   too   set   he exclaimed   O people   I dissociate myself from   all   those   objects   that you associate   with Allah   as His partners  
And they have taken   many other   gods apart from Allah so that they may be a source of honour for them  
If you give charity in public   it is worthwhile   for it will persuade others     but if you hide and deliver it to the poor in secret that is   far   better for you   And Allah will remove from you some of your sins   due to this charity     And Allah is Aware of all that you do  
This   Quran   is the Most Blessed Admonition which We have revealed   Do you deny it  
So are We tired by the first creation     No way     In fact it is they who are in doubt about the new creation  
I shall keep those from   comprehending and accepting   My Revelations who are unjustly arrogant in the land   And   even   if they see all Signs they shall not believe in them and   even   if they find the path of guidance they shall not adopt it as   their   way but if they perceive the wrong path   they will embrace it as their way   It is because they denied Our Revelations an
And had there not been Allahs Grace upon you and His Mercy in this world and in the Hereafter   severe torment would have afflicted you for promoting that   slander   into which you rushed headlong  
So   when they lost hope about Yusuf   Joseph     they counselled   among themselves   in isolation   The eldest   brother   among them said   Do you not know that your father took a firm covenant from you in the Name of Allah   and before that   you also know   you committed excesses in respect of Yusuf   Joseph     So I shall not leave this land at all until my father accords me
They said   Woe to us   Surely   we were wrongdoers  
And undeniably it is the Truth of Absolute Certitude  
Today my wealth has not been able to keep   the torment   away from me even a little  
And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and Allah has encompassed everything  
So man should ponder   and find out   from what substance he has been created  
Then they   the Muslims   returned with the bounties and blessings of Allah   untouched by any suffering   They followed the will of Allah   and Allah is the Lord of Great Bounty  
Surely the torment of their Lord is not a thing which should not be feared  
When it is said to them   Do not spread disorder in the land   they say   It is we who reform  
And disgrace me not on the Day   when   people will be raised up   from the graves    
O mankind     Beware     Let not Satan put you to the test   as he ousted your parents from Paradise   stripping them of their dress so as to unveil to them their private parts   Indeed he   himself   and his clan keep watching you   from such positions where   you cannot catch sight of them   Verily We have made the satans friends of those who do not believe  
And     O Most Esteemed Messenger     We have revealed the Book to you   also   with the Truth which confirms the Book that preceded it and stands as a guardian over   the actual commands and contents contained in   it   So judge between them according to these   Commandments   which Allah has revealed   And do not follow their desires turning away from the Truth that has come to 
Then if they turn away   say   I warn you of that terrible torment like the destruction of Ad and Thamud  
  Allah said     Now   you believe   while you have been   persistently   disobeying and defying before   and you were of those who spread disruption  
  This is   the Glorious Book in which there is no chance of doubt     It is   a guide for those who guard against evil and fear Allah  
And     O Esteemed Messenger     We have not sent you but as a Mercy for all the worlds  
So they whose scales will weigh heavy   due to greater number of good deeds   will be successful and prosperous  
Indeed Allah is not reluctant to narrate some example   for better comprehension     whether of a mosquito or something even more   disgusting   than that  
And Allah is the One Who has made for you shades of many things that He created   and He has made places of shelter for you in the mountains   and He has made   some   such clothes for you as protect you from heat and   others like   coats of armour which shield you   against the enemy assault   during the event of intense war   Thus Allah perfects His favour and blessing   provis
And they   also   say   The   offspring   in the wombs of these cattle is exclusively for our men but forbidden to our women and if that   offspring   is stillborn then they   men and women   all are partners in it   Soon He will punish them for their   invented   dogmas   He is indeed Most Wise   All   Knowing  
  This   is Allahs pattern that has been established through time and you will never find any change in the Laws of Allah  
Reclining there on cushions   face to face  
So   Musa   Moses   returned to his people angered and grieved   and   said   O my people   did your Lord not give you a fair promise   Had a long time lapsed on you in   the fulfilment of   the promise     Or   did you wish that the wrath of your Lord should come due   and befall   you   So you have violated   your   promise to me  
O my Lord   Verily You granted me dominion and blessed me with the knowledge of the interpretation of dreams   O Creator of the heavens and the earth   You are my Helper in this world and in the Hereafter   as well     Make me die in a state of total submission to   Din   Religion   of   Islam and make me join the company of those who are upright  
Peace be upon Musa   Moses   and Harun   Aaron    
Shuaib said   O my people   is my family more venerable to you than Allah   And you have   as if   cast Him   Allah   behind your backs   Surely   my Lord has encompassed   all   your works  
Surely the Godfearing will triumph  
O Believers   Always seek help   from Me   through patience and Prayer   Certainly   Allah is   always   with those who observe patience  
Say   My Prayer   my Hajj   Pilgrimage   and sacrifice   together with the entire worship and servitude   and my life and my death are for Allah alone   Who is the Lord of all the worlds  
And his people had no reply except that they said   Drive them out of the town   indeed they seek extreme purity  
The Command is never changed in My Presence   And nor do I wrong the servants  
Allah said   This   freedom from these deceits and intrigues   is the   very   path that leads straight to My Threshold  
And when they entered Egypt in compliance with what their father had commanded   that command could not save them from Allahs   Decree   but it was Yaqubs   Jacobs   heartfelt desire which he fulfilled and   also take not this desire or strategy as meaningless for you know it not     Surely Yaqub   Jacob   possessed knowledge as We had blessed with   special   knowledge but most p
  Ever since He has chosen you     your Lord has not forsaken you   Nor is He displeased   ever since He has taken you as His Beloved    
Beware that they are in doubt about the Meeting with their Lord   Beware   He is the One Who encompasses everything   with His Knowledge and Power    
And you can aspire only to what Allah intends   Who is the Sustainer of all the worlds  
And by his   Esteemed Messengers   saying   like this     O Lord   surely they are a people who   somehow   do not come to believe  
  These disbelievers   will continue fighting against you endlessly till they turn you back from your Din   Religion   if they become capable to gain   the required   might  
Zakariyya submitted   O my Lord   fix a sign for me   Allah said   The sign for you is that for three days you will not be able to communicate to the people except by gestures   And remember your Lord excessively and glorify Him persistently evening and morning  
And   O Musa   Moses     why did you hasten   in coming to Tur ahead of   your people  
But if you fail to do it and you shall never be able to do it then guard yourselves against the Fire whose fuel is human beings   the disbelievers   and stones   their idols   which is prepared for disbelievers  
Whoever performs pious works   man or woman provided he or she is a believer   We will surely let such a one live a life of purity and will indeed reward them   as well   their wage of the righteous works which they used to do  
And this is because We may make you a Sign   of Our Might   for the people   And   now   see   these   bones how We stir   and raise   them and clothe them with flesh   When this   phenomenon   fully dawned on him   he proclaimed   I have learnt   through the eye of certitude   that Allah is indeed All   Powerful to do everything  
And say     This   Truth is from your Lord   So whoever desires may believe and whoever desires may deny   Indeed We have prepared for the wrongdoers the Fire   of Hell   whose walls will surround them   And if   due to thirst and distress   they cry   they will be helped with water like molten copper which will scald their faces   How dreadful a drink and how terrible a resting p
And that Day every wrongdoer will bite his hands   in fury and frustration and   will say   Would that I had taken the path   of Guidance by joining   the companionship of the Holy Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him    
At that stage the believers were put to trial and were shaken with mighty jolts  
And when Allah took a firm promise from those who were given the Book   You shall communicate it clearly and plainly to the people and shall not hide   whatever is described in it     they cast this promise behind their backs and sold it for a paltry price   This is an extremely evil transaction on their part  
You are to return to Allah and He has Mighty Control over everything  
And We have enjoined upon man to behave benevolently with his parents   And if they struggle with you to make you associate with Me what you have no knowledge of   then do not obey them   To Me you   all   have to return   So I shall inform you of   the deeds   which you used to do   in the world    
  These Verses   are a   public   declaration from Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   for all mankind on the day of the Great Pilgrimage that Allah is absolved of all obligations to the polytheists   and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   too   is free from all obligations to them     So     O polytheists     if you repent that is better for
There   these   people   will neither hear any foolish talk nor belie   one another    
How   curiously   will they hear   with the ears wide open   and how   bewilderedly   will they see   with the eyes stunned   on the Day when they will appear before Us   But today the wrongdoers are but   sunk   into the manifest error  
So go both of you to Pharaoh and say   We are the Messengers   sent   by the Lord of all the worlds  
And in like manner We made the lords   and the affluent   in every community the ringleaders of their crimes   so that they might execute frauds in that   town   and   in fact   they do not defraud anyone other than their own selves   And they are not aware   of its evil outcome    
And the disbelievers say   Do not listen to this Quran but make noises in   its recitation sessions   so that you may overwhelm   their recitation from the Quran    
And We preserved their virtuous remembrance   also   among the succeeding generations  
Ibrahim   Abraham   said   to them     Do you worship these   non   living stones   which you carve out yourselves  
Woe to the deniers on that Day  
This Hell is the recompense of the enemies of Allah   There is a home in it for them to live in forever a requital for their denial of Our Revelations  
  Ibrahim   Abraham     said   Then do you worship apart from Allah these   idols   which can neither bring you any benefit nor do you any harm  
But their hearts are in   utter   negligence of this   message of the Quran   and   also   besides that there are many other   evil   deeds which they are doing  
And what might be any other reason that Allah should not punish these   disbelievers of Makka now after your emigration to Madina   while they hinder people from the Sacred Mosque   Kabatullah   and they do not deserve to be its guardians   or custodians   as well   Its friends   i   e   guardians   are but the righteous people   but most of them do not know   this truth    
Surely   Allah removes from the men of faith   the mischief and strife of their enemies     Indeed He does not like anyone treacherous   and   ungrateful  
Receiving those blessings   in ecstatic delight   which their Lord will be giving them   with munificence and benevolence     Surely it is they who were people of spiritual excellence   in their life   before this  
And when We resolve to destroy a town   We send   some   command to the rich and the affluent among them   so that the common man and the poor too may make amends   but they act disobediently in   the town     Thus Our decree   of torment   becomes due against it   Then We totally smash that town  
Surely Allah has cursed the disbelievers and has kept ready for them the Blazing Fire   of Hell    
Surely those who say   Our Lord is Allah   then stick to it   firmly     angels descend upon them   and say     Do not fear nor grieve and rejoice in the Paradise that you were promised  
Then certainly after this   life   you shall die  
Say   This is what is revealed to me that your God is One God   only     Do you then accept Islam  
That   proof   is the   last   Messenger from Allah   who recites   to them   holy pages   of the Glorious Quran    
He said   I saw what these people had not seen   I took a handful   of dust   from the footstep of the angel   that visited you     then I cast it   into the model of the calf   and this way my   lower   self made   it   attractive to me  
So always eat of that clean and lawful sustenance which Allah has given you and thank for the favour of Allah if you worship but Him alone  
  Dhul   Qarnain   said   The power my Lord has given me in this connection is better   Assist me with your vigour   diligence and labour   and I shall erect a fortified wall between you and them  
Indeed they alone invent false fabrications who do not believe in the Revelations of Allah and they alone are liars  
Ibrahim   Abraham   said   O deputed angels   what is your basic intent   of coming   apart from this good news    
  So it   is Light upon Light   i   e   the Light of Prophethood upon the Light of the Holy Essence   denoting a Self   embodying double Light    
Say   Shall I apprise you of him who   in the matter of punishment   is worse in the sight of Allah than   the one you regard the most despised   And it is he   whom Allah has cursed   whom He has shown His wrath   and He has transformed   some   of these   evil people   into apes and   others into   swines   and   he is such a person   as has   obeyed and   worshipped Satan   The
And   recall also the time   when Musa   Moses   prayed for water for his people   We directed   Strike that rock with your stick   Then twelve springs gushed out of that   rock     Verily each clan identified their respective drinking place     We said     Eat and drink of the sustenance   given   by Allah but do not seek doing mischief in the land  
There is indeed sure warning and admonition in it for him who has a heart   vigilant and awake   far from negligence     or listens with active attention   i   e   focuses attention having no contact with anyone other than Allah   and is in a state of   spiritual   vision   i   e   remains lost in the effulgent disclosures of Allahs absolute beauty and charisma    
He said   Certainly the torment and wrath upon you from your Lord has become inevitable   Do you dispute with me over the names   of those idols   which you   yourselves   and your ancestors have   supposedly   named and for which Allah has not sent down any authority   So wait   for the torment     I am   also   with you among those who wait  
And verily We gave Musa     Moses   the Book   of guidance and   after him   We made the Children of Israel the inheritors of that   Book    
  Allah will   say   Stay on therein with disgrace and do not speak to Me  
  The people of   Ad too rejected   the Messengers     So how   awful   My torment   upon them   and My Warning were  
Assuredly We created man and We know   also   the doubts which his   ill   commanding   self puts   into his heart and mind     And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein  
Isa son of Maryam   Jesus son of Mary   said   O Allah   our Lord   send down to us from heaven the table spread   with bounties   so that   the day of its descent   becomes   Id   Festival Day for us   and for our predecessors   as well as   successors   and that   spread table   comes as a Sign from You   and provide us with sustenance   and You are the Best Sustainer  
They are like clothes for you and you are like clothes for them  
And do not make fun of Allahs Commands  
So We granted his prayer and We blessed him with Yahya   John   and for his sake made his wife healthy   fertile     Surely they   all   used to hasten in   doing   pious deeds and used to call on Us   feeling   eager   fond   fearful and frightened   and used to humble before Our Presence in tearful submissions  
As if they were startled   wild   donkeys  
Say   Allah is the One Who knows best for how long they remained   there     He alone knows   all   the secrets of the heavens and the earth   How well He sees and how well He hears   They have no protector besides Him   nor does He share His Sovereignty with anyone  
  It will be said to them     Do not call out   just   for one destruction today but call for many more destructions  
Indeed those who believe and keep doing pious actions   it is they who are the best of the Creation  
He is the One Who shows you His Signs and sends down sustenance for you from the heaven   And only he who remains inclined   to Allah alone   accepts advice  
And Allah provided you help in the battle of Badr   whereas you had little resources   at that time     Therefore   fear Allah so that you may become grateful  
  Jibrail   Gabriel     said   I am only a messenger from your Lord     I have come   to bestow upon you a pure son  
And there will be no supporters for the   disbelievers   to help them against Allah   And he whom Allah holds astray   there is no way left for him   towards guidance    
  Boasting     he says   I have spent heaps of wealth  
And certainly We did create you   i   e   your real being     then gave you shape   i   e   accomplished the phases of chemical and biological genesis and evolution of life till the completion of the physical existence of Adam     Then We commanded the angels   Prostrate yourselves before Adam   They all prostrated themselves except Iblis   he was not of those who prostrate themse
And they kept perpetrating huge frauds   to keep the common man in error    
  They will dwell   in such evergreen gardens which the Most Kind   Lord   has promised to His servants in the Unseen   Certainly His promise is about to come true  
And   the departing soul   comes to realize that   now   is the hour of parting   with all    
They will abide there for recurrent   infinite periods  
But as for him whose scales of deeds in the balance will be light  
Do you command others for piety and forget yourselves   while you   also   recite the Book   of Allah     So   do you not think  
Say   Is this   a   better   state   or the   life of   eternal Paradise promised to the Godfearing   This is their reward   of deeds   and their abode  
And   also call to your mind the time   when We delivered you from Pharaohs people   who used to inflict severe torment upon you   they slaughtered your sons and kept your daughters alive   There was an arduously terrible trial in it from your Lord  
  On that Day   people will not possess the authority to intercede except those who have taken a promise   of intercession   from the Most Kind   Lord    
And does not promote the cause of feeding the poor   i   e   does not strive to end the economic exploitation of the poor and the needy    
Do you assume that you will enter Paradise   without any good   whereas Allah has not yet tested those of you who combat for His cause   nor has He judged the steadfast  
It is a fact that these are certainly those who are the losers in the Hereafter  
And in fact We put to trial the people of Pharaoh   also   before them and the exalted Messenger   Musa   Moses     came to them  
And the divorced women must also be provided with maintenance according to what is fair   This is compulsory for the pious  
Is this   Sign   not enough for them that We have revealed to you   that   Book which is recited to them   or will always be recited     Surely in this   Book   there is mercy and direction and guidance for the believers  
He blesses with wisdom whom He wills   And he who is granted wisdom   and reason   receives tremendous good   And only those who are endowed with wisdom and insight receive direction and guidance  
And that among us are some who are pious and there are also some   evil   exceptions among us   We were   following   different ways  
Say   Shall We alert you of those who are great losers in respect of deeds  
A feature of the Paradise which is promised to the Godfearing is that there are in it streams of   such   water as will never putrefy   in smell or colour     and   in it   will be streams of milk whose taste and flavour will never change and streams of   such a pure   wine that is an absolute delight for all who drink it and streams of purified honey   and   in it   will be fruit
But if his shirt is torn from behind then she is a liar and he is of the truthful  
  The Messengers   said   Our Lord knows that assuredly we have been sent to you  
And the people of Nuh     Noah   as well   when they denied the Prophets   We drowned them and made them a Sign of warning for   other   people   And We have prepared a painful torment for the wrongdoers  
And He is the One Who is God in the heaven and God in the earth   as well   and He is Most Wise   All   Knowing  
And We have not created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them without any purpose   And the Hour of Resurrection is certainly approaching   So     O embodiment of excellent morality     bear with   them   most graciously and effectively with perseverance  
And Allah does not fear any repercussions of this   devastation    
Ha   Mim   Only Allah and the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   know the real meaning    
Do they not know that Allah is aware of their secrets and their whisperings and that Allah knows best all unseen things  
The Day when they will come forth from their graves in haste as if they are running towards the temples of their idols  
And eat of the pure and lawful things which Allah has provided for you with and always fear Allah Whom you believe in  
So which of your Lords blessings will you both deny  
A glimpse of the Paradise that has been promised to the Godfearing   depicts that   it has rivers flowing under it   Its fruits are everlasting   and so   also   is its shade   This is   the beauty of   the end of those who adopt Godwariness   And the end of the disbelievers is the Fire of Hell  
But whoever will do that through transgression and injustice   We shall soon throw him into the Fire   of Hell   and that is very easy for Allah  
And keep praying   to your Lord     O my Lord   make me enter   wherever You are to make me enter   with the Truth   Your pleasure     and bring me out   from wherever You are to bring me out   with the Truth   Your pleasure     And bestow upon me from Your Presence the dominance that assists and the power that backs  
That is   the Command     And whoever takes revenge in proportion to the torture inflicted upon him and then he is again wronged   Allah will surely help him   Allah is verily Most Forgiving   Most Pardoning  
So turn your attention away from them for a time  
Then We drowned the others  
And man says   Shall I be soon brought forth alive when I die  
And not imposed upon them   as   a despot and oppressor  
Not a word does he utter with the mouth but a watcher is there beside him ready   to write it    
Allah is Most Bountiful and Benevolent towards His servants   He bestows His sustenance and Bounty upon whom He wills   And He is Most Strong   Almighty  
Say     All this   is due to the Bounty and Mercy of Allah   bestowed upon you through raising Muhammad   Allah bless him and give him peace   as the Holy Messenger     So the Muslims should rejoice over it   This is far better than   all that affluence and wealth   that they amass  
And verily this   Quran   is the most great honour for you and for your Umma   Community     And     O people     you will soon be asked   how strong and firm a relation you established with the Quran    
All that is   a source of   insight   direction and guidance for every servant who turns   to Allah in repentance    
And   O my people   I do not   also   demand from you any wealth for   promoting and preaching this message     My reward is only   a bountiful obligation   upon Allah   Nor shall I drive away   for your sake   these   poor and backward   people who have accepted faith     Do not consider them inferior   It is they who are in fact superior and respectable     Surely they are those
Say   to these disbelievers     I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah   nor do I know the unseen myself   and nor do I say to you that I am an angel   I follow only that   Commandment   which is revealed to me   Say   Can the blind and the seeing be equal   So do you not ponder  
They said   O Hud   you have not brought us any clear proof   Nor are we going to forsake our gods at your behest and nor are we to believe in you  
And when Our torment came upon them   their cry was nothing   else   but they began to say   No doubt we were the wrongdoers  
And when they hear anything absurd they turn away from it and say   For us are our deeds and for you are your deeds   Peace be upon you   We do not want   to adopt the mentality and conduct of   the ignorant     Why should we give up our good for the sake of their evil    
Yet   they all drank of it except a few  
Or increase it a little more to it   And recite the Quran with most pleasant pauses  
Assemble all those who committed injustice and their companions and followers and those   false gods as well   that they used to worship  
And when it is said to them   the disbelievers     Follow that which Allah has sent down   they say     Indeed not     We shall rather follow the same   path   on which we found our ancestors   even though their ancestors had neither any sense nor any guidance  
in the   rain   water which Allah pours down from the sky reviving therewith the earth to life after its death     the earth   in which He has scattered animals of all kinds   and in the changing wind directions and in the clouds   that trail   between the sky and the earth   duty   bound   under Allahs Command   certainly  
And his   end   is the admission to Hell  
  Sulaiman   Solomon     said   We see right now whether you speak the truth or you are of the liars  
Then will change it into a levelled   barren land  
And throw your stick   on the ground     So when Musa   Moses   saw it moving fast coiling and curling as if it was a snake   he turned his back   jogged off and did not look behind     The Voice said     O Musa   Moses     come forth and do not fear   Surely you are of the secure  
Surely those who argue about the Revelations of Allah without any authority having come to them   there is nothing in their breasts except vain superiority   they will never be able to attain to that   true superiority     So keep seeking refuge with Allah   from their evil     Surely He alone is All   Hearing   All   Seeing  
So judge between me and them and deliver me and the believers who are in my company  
And no doubt We sent many Messengers before you   We have given you an account of some of them while We have not   yet   narrated to you the annals of some others   And it was not possible for any Messenger to bring any Sign without Allahs leave   Then when the command of Allah came   and   the judgment was given with truth and justice the exponents of evil went into loss  
How   can one expect from them honouring of the agreement     They are in such a state that if they overpower you they will have regard neither for any tie of kinship with you nor for any covenant   They please you with lip service only   but their hearts deny   all what they say     And most of them are those who break agreements  
He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth with a rationale and purpose   And   He is the One Who   gave you shapes and then did up your shapes   And   all   have to return to Him alone  
If they had   really   resolved to move out   for fighting   they would have procured   at least some   equipment for that   But   the fact is that owing to their falsehood and hypocrisy   Allah disliked   even   their rising up   for fighting     So   He stopped them   there     And it was said to them   Sit in the company of those who sit   shirking from fight    
That is because they hate that   Book   which Allah has sent down so He has made their actions come to nothing  
And this is how We elucidate Our Revelations so that they may turn   towards the Truth    
  The guest angels   said   Do not feel afraid   We give you the glad tidings of   the birth of   a son endowed with knowledge and wisdom  
And indeed We sent Musa   Moses   too   with Our Signs and a clear proof  
Have they not travelled in the earth and seen what was the end of those before them   They were more powerful than them   And they cultivated the earth and inhabited it far more than these people have done   Then their Messengers came to them with clear Signs   So Allah would not wrong them but they wronged their souls themselves  
And when they are called to Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   that he may judge between them   a party of them turns away   from appearing before the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him      
Alif   Lam   Mim     Only Allah and the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   know the real meaning    
The Night of Destiny is better than a thousand months   in merit of excellence   blessings   reward and recompense    
And no one knows the armies of your Lord except Him   And this   description of Hell is nothing else   but an admonition to mankind  
He is the One Who sent down calmness and tranquillity into the hearts of the believers so that their faith gets increased with more faith   and the faith learnt the knowledge of certitude changes into the faith seen   the eye of certitude     And all the armies of the heavens and the earth belong to Allah alone   And Allah is All   Knowing   Most Wise  
What are they waiting for   save   the Hour that should seize them all of a sudden while they have no awareness of it  
  O people     Follow this   Quran   which has been sent down to you from your Lord   and do not follow   any heretic rulers and   friends other than Him   You take advice but little  
There is no falsehood in its occurrence  
Is it that when we are dead and have become dust   then we shall become alive again     This return is far   from understanding and perception    
And We made Isa   Jesus   son of Maryam   Mary   and his mother Our   Great   Sign   And We provided them a comfortable and facilitated living place on a pleasant   elevated ground fit for living with ease and comfort   and there was flowing water   i   e   streams   waterfalls and springs a feast   for sight  
And the evildoers will see the Fire of Hell and realize that certainly they are about to fall into it   And they will not be able to find any means to escape from it  
On that Day no intercession shall be fruitful except his   intercession   whom the Most Kind   Lord   has granted leave   and permission   and with whose word He is pleased   such as Prophets and Messengers   Allahs chosen and fearing servants   Godwary slaves   innocent children and many other devoted servants of Allah whose intercession is validated    
And those who hold fast to the Book   of Allah   and establish Prayer   with punctuality   then   certainly We do not waste the reward of those who reform  
The People of Lut   Lot   also rejected the Warners  
And He brightened in them the moon and made the sun a radiant lamp   i   e   the source of light and heat    
And your Lord is Self   Sufficient   Lord of   Great   Mercy   If He wills He can eliminate you and   after you   make your successor whom He likes as He has raised you from the descendants of another people  
But when the bearer of the glad tidings arrived   and he cast that shirt over Yaqub   Jacobs   face   his sight returned the same moment   Yaqub   Jacob   said   Did I not say to you that I know from Allah what you do not know  
It is neither   merely   eastern nor western   rather universal and cosmic in its generously infinite luminosity  
Then he prayed to his Lord   Surely they are a sinful people  
Have they not seen the birds above them spreading out their wings and   sometimes   folding them   Nothing can hold them   from falling down in the air   except   the law made by   the Most Kind   Lord     Surely He sees everything best  
This is because of the doings which your hands sent forth   and indeed Allah is not in the least unjust to His servants  
These are the Verses of the Book that makes clear   the Truth    
The Truth is that they will be screened off   to deprive them of   the sight of their Lord  
So this is what they always bewailed till We made them like a reaped field   and a heap   of extinguished fire  
And by the heaven and by that   energy   which built it   with Allahs permission in the form of a vast universe    
The affluent should spend   according to   his means   And whoever is provided sustenance scarcely   let him spend   on her maintenance   out of the provision which Allah has given him   Allah does not burden anyone beyond what He has given him   Allah will soon bring about ease after hardship  
And when Allah will say   O Isa son of Maryam   Jesus son of Mary     Did you ask the people to take you and your mother as two gods besides Allah   He will submit   Glory be to You   It is not   justified   for me to say such a thing as I have no right to say   Had I said it You would surely have known it   You know every such   thing   that is in my heart   but I do not know tho
So   by your Lord   We will certainly gather them and   all   Satans together   on the Day of Judgment     We will then bring them   all   around Hell fallen down in kneeling position  
He is the Knower of the unseen and the seen   the Most Great   and   the Most Exalted  
  And they will say     What has brought you into Hell  
So We will most certainly make the disbelievers taste the severe torment   and will most certainly requite them for the evil deeds which they used to do  
And two seas   or rivers   cannot be the same   this   one   is sweet   thirst   quenching and pleasant to drink and that   other   is salty and very bitter   And you eat fresh meat from each and bring forth ornaments   including pearls and corals   that you wear   And you see in them boats   and ships   that chop through   the water     so that you may seek His bounty   through m
  And they were cursed also because   they would not prevent one another from the evil deeds they used to do   Evil certainly were the deeds that they used to do  
O Believers   Do not ruin your charity donations   later   by taunts of doing favour and hurting feelings like the one who gives charity to show off his wealth to the people and believes in neither Allah nor the Last Day   His case is like a smooth rock covered with a thin coat of soil   Then heavy rain falls on it   washes it clean and leaves it   the same   bare and hard   rock 
After that   they have preferred your pleasure and your service to the worldly benefits     it is not lawful for you also   to marry   more women   so that these wives alone may enjoy the distinction of their glory     Nor is it lawful that   in case of divorce to some and regarding it Our Command to maintain the present number of wives   you take   into marriage   other wives in 
And on the Day when the trumpet is blown   then   all   those in the heavens and in the earth will be terrified except those whom Allah pleases   will not worry     And all will appear before His Presence submissively  
Such is Isa son of Maryam   Jesus son of Mary   That is   the truth about which these people doubt  
Indeed there was a party of My servants who used to submit   before My Presence     O our Lord   we have believed   so forgive us and have Mercy on us   And   surely   You are the Best of the merciful  
And that He alone is the Lord of Sirius   a star that was worshipped in the days of ignorance    
O Believers   Wine and gambling and idols mounted   for worship   and divining arrows   for seeking luck   all   are filthy works of Satan   So turn away from them   completely   so that you may prosper  
So when they came back to Yusuf     Joseph   again     they submitted   O Aziz   of Egypt     distress has fallen upon us and our family   and we are suffering from dreadful famine     And we have brought only   this   meager amount   So give us full measure   of grain against it   and   in addition   extend to us   some   charity   as well     Indeed Allah rewards those who give 
And these are the people who do not attend     both verbally and practically     the false and untruthful matters   and when they pass by evil activities   they pass on   observing caution   with utmost nobility and dignity  
The pearls   shading green   and corals   shading red   come forth from both   the seas    
He said   Musa   Moses     have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic  
Can he who was dead   i   e   devoid of faith     then We gave him life   by guidance   and created for him the light   of faith and gnosis     and   now   by means of that he walks among   the rest of   the people   also to spread that light   be like the one who is steeped in the darkness of   ignorance and error in such a way   that he can by no means come out of it   Likewise 
If a debtor is under financial stress   he should be given respite till he feels at ease to pay   And your forgoing   the loan   is better for you if you know   what significance it has in the sight of Allah to console the poor    
This   narration   is of the accounts of the unseen that We reveal to you   Neither you nor your people knew them before this   So observe patience   Surely it is the Godfearing with whom it ends well  
  Reaching the sacred land   he prayed     O my Lord   bless me with   a son     one of the pious  
Whoever turns away from it will certainly carry an unmanageable burden on the Day of Rising  
Produce your book if you are truthful  
That is how We pay back those who are committed to spiritual excellence  
Then   it will be said to him     Peace for you from those on the Right Hand     Or   O Prophet   peace on you from those on the Right Hand    
So have they not travelled in the earth that they could see how they met their fate who passed before them   They were far greater   in number   than these people and mightier in power and   much more advanced   in respect of the remains and traces   as well   that   they   have left behind in the earth   But whatever they used to earn brought them no benefit  
By the illumined Book  
Do you ask them for wages that they are weighed down with debt  
And after Musa     Moses   left for the Mount of Tur     his people contrived a calf out of their ornaments   which was   a carving with a mooing sound   Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor show them any path   They took the same   as god   and they were unjust  
And a barrier was placed between them and their desires   as was done before with the people of their kind   Surely they were suffering from a deceiving doubt  
He said   remorsefully     I have committed love for wealth   i   e   horses   more than the love for the remembrance of my Lord until   the sun   disappeared behind the veil   of night    
And the inmates of Hell will call out to the inhabitants of Paradise   Bless us with some water   of Paradise   or of   the provision   that Allah has granted you   They will say   Allah has indeed forbidden both   these bounties   to the disbelievers  
And when the believers saw the armies   of disbelievers   they said   This is what Allah and His Messenger promised us and Allah and His Messenger have spoken the truth   So this   spectacle   increased their faith and their commitment to submission to Allah  
And Musa   Moses   said   O Pharaoh   Indeed I am   raised as   a Messenger from the Lord of all the worlds  
Except for those who offer Prayer  
And the moon when it appears full  
And they say   When we shall become   decomposed   bones and dust particles   after dying     shall we be raised up alive anew  
By this Light   Giving Book  
So   make a piece of heaven fall on us   if you are truthful  
Say   O disbelievers  
And We blessed him with Ishaq   Isaac   and Yaqub     Jacob   a son and a grandson   and We ordained Prophethood and the Book in Ibrahims descendants   And We gave him his reward   here   in this world and surely he is among the most pious in the Hereafter   as well    
O our Lord   Take us out from here   Then if we repeat   the same error   we shall certainly be the wrongdoers  
So     no sooner did the light of Allahs effulgence light in the human organism than   all the angels fell down in prostration together  
Have you gone fearless of   the Lord of   the heaven that He may sink you into the earth when it suddenly shakes  
  It will be said to them     Enter them peacefully   throwing away fears  
A guidance and good news for   those   believers  
They are brought before the Fire of Hell morning and evening   And the Day when Resurrection occurs   a Voice will command     Cast the people of Pharaoh into the most miserable chastisement  
And how many a Sign is there in the heavens and the earth which these people pass by but they are heedless of them  
And the wife of Pharaoh said   on seeing Musa   Moses         This child   is coolness of eyes for me and for you   do not kill him   He may perhaps bring us benefit or we may adopt him as a son   And they were unaware   of the outcome of this plan    
But their   actual   promise is the Last Hour and the Last Hour is extremely terrible and most agonizing  
Have you not seen those who make friends with such a party upon whom Allah sent wrath   They are neither of you nor of them and take false oaths while they know  
And   on the contrary   among people there is also someone who sells even his life to attain the pleasure of Allah   And Allah is Most Kind to the servants  
Woe to the deniers on that Day  
And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice  
O people   We created you from a male and a female   and   divided   you into   large   peoples and tribes   so that you might recognize one another   Surely the most honourable among you in the sight of Allah is he who fears Allah most   Certainly Allah is All   Knowing   All   Aware  
And warn them of the Day of impending calamity when hearts will rise to throats due to the suppressed grief   The wrongdoers will have neither any kind friend nor any influential intercessor  
And between both   of them i   e   the inmates of Paradise and Hell   there is a barrier   ramparts or heights     and on the Araf   the ramparts   there will be men who will recognize all by their features   And they will call out to the people of Paradise   Peace be upon you   They   the people of the Araf   the Heights     will not have entered Paradise   themselves as yet   bu
And He has made subservient to you   out of His will   whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth   all of it   under a system     Surely there are Signs in it for those who ponder  
Have these evil and deceitful people gone free of the fear that Allah may sink them into the earth   or may send to them torment from   any   quarter that is beyond their imagination  
Men have a share in   the assets   that their parents and nearest kin leave behind and women   also   have a share in the inheritance of their parents and the nearest kin   Be it small or large   the share has been fixed   by Allah    
He is the One Who cleaves through the dark of the night and causes the   light of   the day to burst forth   And He is the One Who has made the night for rest and the sun and the moon for reckoning and computing   This is the appointed measure of the Almighty   the All   Knowing   Lord    
Nay   We strike at falsehood with the Truth with full force   So   the Truth crushes it and it   i   e   falsehood   gets destroyed   And you are bound to ruin yourselves owing to what you utter  
And some among them are those who pass sarcastic remarks against you in the matter of   distribution of   alms   If they are given some portion of   the alms   they feel pleased   but if nothing is given to them they feel annoyed at once  
And had your Lord so willed   He would have made mankind one Umma   Community   But He has not done so by force   On the contrary He has given free choice to all to adopt a religion     And   now   these people will always hold divergent views  
And he should fear Allah   Who is his Sustainer   and   while writing   he should not diminish anything   from the indebted sum    
Say   I do not find in that Revelation which has been sent to me anything forbidden to anyone who eats   such things   as he takes in food except carrion   or running blood   or the flesh of swine   for it is filthy and impious   or the sinfully slaughtered animal on which some name other than Allahs Name has been invoked at the time of slaughter   But he who becomes helpless   du
Say   Come   I will recite to you those things which your Lord has forbidden to you   Do not set up anything as a partner with Him   be morally excellent with parents   and do not kill your children owing to poverty   We alone give you sustenance and   will provide for   them as well   And do not draw near to shameful deeds   whether   open or hidden   And do not kill the soul who
And the Jews say   The Christians do not have their base upon anything   i   e   sound faith     and the Christians say   The Jews do not have their base upon anything   yet they   all   read the Book   revealed by Allah    
Do you consider   mere   serving of drinking water to the pilgrims and the management of populating and maintaining the Sacred Mosque   an act   equal to   the works of   a person who believes in Allah and the Last Day and fights in the cause of Allah   They cannot be equal in the sight of Allah and Allah does not guide those who do injustice  
Whereas   the relish for and comfort of   the Hereafter is preferable and everlasting  
So which of your Lords blessings will you both deny  
And it is not the Glory of the Most Kind   Lord   to take   someone as   a son  
Until when We seize the rich and the prosperous of them with torment   then they will cry out  
And   also call to mind the account of   Dawud   David   and Sulaiman   Solomon   when both of them were to decide   the dispute   of a crop when the goats of a tribe unattended by the shepherd entered the field at night   and destroyed it     And We were witnessing their judgment  
Maryam   Mary   submitted   O my Lord   how shall I have a son when no man has ever touched me   He said   Just as Allah creates what He pleases   When He decides   to do   some work   He just gives it the Command Be   and it becomes  
These   disbelievers   ask you about the Last Hour   When will it take place   Say   Knowledge of it rests with my Lord alone   none but He   Allah   will manifest it at its   appointed   time   It is   seemingly   heavy on   the residents of   the heavens and the earth   due to the horror of its adversities and intensities     It will occur to you all of a sudden   accidentally  
And those who lack knowledge say   Why does Allah not speak to us or why does any Sign not come to us   directly     Likewise the people before them also said words similar to theirs   The hearts of   all   these people are alike   We have indeed made the Signs explicit for those whose faith is firm  
Indeed those who believe   then disbelieve and then believe again and reject faith once more and then advance further in denying faith   Allah will never   incline to   forgive them   nor guide them to the straight road  
And I do not demand of you any wages for this   preaching of the Truth     My reward is only with the Lord of all the worlds  
And had they established   their systems by enforcing   the Torah and the Injil   the Gospel   and whatever   more   was sent down to them from their Lord   they would have   been provided with the material resources so abundantly that they would have   received sustenance from above and from beneath their feet   as well   but the sustenance would never have exhausted     A sectio
And who remain steadfast in seeking the pleasure of their Lord   and establish Prayer and spend   both   secretly and openly out of the sustenance We have provided and continue eliminating evil by means of good   they are the ones for whom there is a   beautiful   home in the Hereafter  
It has seven doors   for each one a fixed portion of them has been specified  
The only Revelation that is sent to me   from Allah   is but I am a clear and straight Warner  
And from amongst you there must be a community comprising the people who would invite mankind towards piety   bid righteousness and forbid evil   And they are the successful people  
They seek to deceive Allah   i   e   the Messenger   and the believers but   in fact   they deceive only themselves and they are not aware of it  
And surely he who keeps patience and forgives   it is certainly of the deeds which demand great courage and resolve  
And those who believe in   all   that which has been revealed to you and that which was revealed before you   and also have   perfect   faith in the life after death  
And   they   will be   staying   on raised   splendid   floors  
And We indeed provided the Children of Israel with a worthy place to dwell in and with pure and clean sustenance   They did not differ in anything   until knowledge and insight reached them   Your Lord will surely judge among them on the Day of Resurrection in matters wherein they used to differ  
And this is   that   Book which We have sent down   the most blessed one   It   authentically   confirms those revealed Books that preceded it   And   this   has been   sent down   in order that   firstly   you warn the residents of the nucleus of all the   human   communities   Makka   and   secondly   the dwellers around it   the world over     And only those who believe in it h
And Pharaoh   arrogantly   proclaimed among his people   saying   O my people   is not the kingdom of Egypt under my control   and   are   these streams   not mine   which are flowing beneath my   palaces     So do you not see  
Surely if You leave them   alive   they will keep leading your servants astray and will beget none but the most wicked and extremely disbelieving children  
  Satan   for whom it is written that whoever takes him for a friend   he will lead him astray and show him the road to the torment of Hell  
And that all his endeavours will soon be shown   i   e   exposed    
So   this way   We returned Musa   Moses   to his mother so that her eyes might keep cool and so that she might not feel grieved and in order that she might know   with certitude   that Allahs promise is true but most of the people do not know  
Surely Allah was well pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you under the tree   at al   Hudaibiya     So the   passion of truth and fidelity   that permeated their hearts   Allah had its knowledge and sent down an exceptional calmness and tranquillity   into their hearts and awarded them the forthcoming victory   of Khaibar    
It happened because they posed extreme enmity against Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him       Their ringleader was Kab ibn Ashraf   a notorious denigrator of the Holy Prophet   blessings and peace be upon him       And he who opposes Allah   and His Messenger   then Allah is Severe in punishment  
Ibrahim   Abraham   was neither a Jew nor a Christian   he was a   true   Muslim   far detached from all heresy and falsehood   Nor was he one of the polytheists  
Have you not seen how Allah has created seven   or many   heavenly spheres corresponding to one another   layer upon layer    
And   then   We shall turn to the deeds they   presumably   did   in life   and shall make them scattered dust particles  
So turn away your kind and caring looks from them   There is no blame on you   for their disbelief    
  The Lord   said   So this   land   is forbidden to these   rebels   for forty years     Anguished     they will keep wandering around the earth distractedly   So you will not grieve     O Musa     Moses     over the   warning plight   of these disobedient and unruly people  
And warn by means of this   Quran   those who fear that they will be assembled before their Lord while they are without   any   helper or intercessor apart from Him so that they may become pious  
Beware     Truly   it is they who spread disorder   but they do not have any sense   of it   at all  
Ya   Sin     Only Allah and the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   know the real meaning    
And who can be more in error than someone who worships such   idols   apart from Allah as cannot answer   his question   till the Day of Resurrection   And those   idols   have no consciousness of their   very   prayer and worship  
And when the infant girl buried alive will be asked  
On account of this We prescribed   this Commandment in the Torah sent down   to the Children of Israel that whoever killed a person   unjustly     except as a punishment for murder or for   spreading   disorder in the land   i   e   punishment for bloodshed and robbery etc       it would be as if he killed all the people   of society     and whoever   saved him from unjust murder 
Indeed it is binding on Us to show you the path   of Truth    
They swear to you so that you may feel pleased with them   So     O Muslims     if you are pleased with them   even   then Allah will not be pleased with the disobedient people  
And We produced in it gardens of date   palms and grapes   and also caused some springs as well to gush forth in it  
  It will be said to them     Do not cry today   Surely you shall not be helped by Us  
And those who reject Allahs Revelations and deny meeting with Him   they despair of My Mercy   And it is they for whom there is painful punishment  
  He is   Most Kind Who settled on the Throne   of Power and Supreme Authority over all the systems of the universe befitting His Glory    
But if they desist   then surely Allah is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
O my Lord   Make me and my children the ones who establish Prayer   O my Lord   and grant my prayer  
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize this   last of the Messengers   as they recognize their sons   They are those who have brought   eternal   loss upon their souls   but they will not believe  
And to give them governance and power in the land and show Pharaoh and Haman and their armies   the revolution   that they used to fear  
For of stones there are some from which streams burst out   and   certainly   some out of them are such   stones   that split up and water gushes out of them  
But   now   they have rejected this   Quran     So they will soon come to know   their end    
He submitted   O my Lord   my bones have grown tender and   my   head has turned white like a flame due to old age and   O my Lord   I have never been unblessed when supplicating You  
Let again   Allahs   woe   curse   be to him   How he schemed  
Allah has   at present   lightened the burden   of His Commandment   on you   He knows that there is   some degree of   weakness in you   So   now after mitigation the Command is   that if there are   one   hundred resolute and steadfast   men   from amongst you   they will overpower two hundred   disbelievers     And if there are   one   thousand of you   they will triumph over t
Remember   To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth   And those who worship   idols   besides Allah do not   in fact   follow   even   their   own sculptured   associate   gods   They follow but only   their own   assumption and conjecture   and they indulge in merely wrong guesswork  
Which he will take sip by sip with great difficulty   and will not be able to gulp it down the throat   And death will assail him from all sides   and he will not be able   even   to die   And that   again   will be followed by   one more   extremely grievous torment  
They are the people who are disbelievers   and   mischief   mongers   evildoers    
Surely your God is One  
They are neither worthy nor capable   of it    
And it will be said to them   Where are those   idols   which you used to worship  
He is the One Who will cause me to die and then He alone will give me life   again    
  O Beloved     Did He not find you an orphan   and then provided you   a dignifying and graceful   abode  
They said   O Dhul   Qarnain   Gog and Magog have spread disorder in the land   Should we fix some money   as a tribute   for you on this   condition   that you raise a high wall between us and them  
By the winds that blow and scatter  
Indeed those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and remain engaged in creating mischief in the land   i   e   perpetrate terrorism   robbery and burglary among the Muslims     their punishment is that they be slain   or hanged to death   or their hands and their feet on opposite sides be cut off   or they be exiled far from   i   e   d
But such disbelievers   persistently strive to   belie   the Truth    
And it will cast out all that is inside it and become empty  
And when they felt deeply ashamed of what they had done   and realized that they had really gone astray   they said   If our Lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us   we shall certainly be among the losers  
And cast down   this staff   that is in your right hand   on the ground     It will swallow up that   craft   which they have contrived   artificially     Whatever they have wrought is but a deceitful trick of a sorcerer   and wherever a magician may come   he will not be successful  
  That   is Harun   Aaron     my brother  
And be steadfast   Surely Allah does not let the reward of the pious go to waste  
Then both set off   until they reached the people of a town   both asked its residents for food but they refused to entertain them   Then they found there a wall which was about to fall     Khidr   erected it   Musa   Moses   said   If you desired   you could take wages for this   construction work    
Did We create the angels as females and were they present   on the occasion    
If He wills He would cause the wind to be absolutely still and the vessels would stand halted on the surface of the sea   Surely there are Signs in it for everyone who observes patience and remains grateful  
And ask the Messengers We sent before you whether We made any gods to be worshipped instead of the Most Kind   Lord    
In their hearts is a disease   So Allah has worsened their disease   For them   there is painful punishment because they used to tell lies  
This   Quran   is nothing   else   but the words of a human being  
And who is it among them to say   I am a god besides   Allah     So   him We shall award Hell as punishment   This is the way We punish the wrongdoers  
So is it magic or do you not see  
Then Ibrahim   Abraham   cast a look at the stars   to put them in doubt    
And they will say   All gratitude and praise belong to Allah Who has removed from us all grief   Surely our Lord is Most Forgiving   Most Appreciative of gratitude  
He knows all those   things   which are ahead of them and which are behind them   and they cannot encompass His   knowledge   with   their   knowledge  
And do they want Our punishment to be hastened  
Verily I am Allah   There is no God other than Me   So always worship Me and establish Prayer for the sake of My remembrance  
Neither the disbelievers among the People of the Book nor the polytheists like that any blessing should descend upon you from your Lord   And Allah especially chooses whom He pleases for His Mercy   And Allah possesses Infinite Bounties  
So Most High and Exalted is Allah   He alone is the True Sovereign   And do not hasten in   reciting   the Quran before its revelation is fully accomplished to you   And always submit   before the Holy Presence of your Lord     O my Lord   increase me further in knowledge  
Have they   the disbelievers   taken from   the contents of   the earth gods that can raise   the dead   alive  
And when they faced Jalut   Goliath   and his forces   they supplicated Allah   O our Lord   grant us plentiful patience and make our steps firm and give us victory over the disbelievers  
But they will never long for it because of the sins   and atrocities   their hands have sent ahead   or have committed already   and Allah knows the wrongdoers full well  
And collect the provisions required for the journey   to the Hereafter    
The revelation of   this   Book is from Allah   Almighty   Most Wise  
If you keep abstaining from major sins that you are forbidden to do We shall remove from you your minor sins and shall admit you to a place of honour  
Indeed those who disbelieved and hindered   the people   from the Way of Allah and opposed the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him       and chose the path of breaking away from him     after the guidance   i   e   the gnosis of the veneration of the Holy Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     had become clear to them   they would not be able to harm Allah anyway 
That will be the Day   of Resurrection   when We shall move the mountains   in the atmosphere   broken to dust particles     and you will see the earth as a clear plain   void of plantation   stones   animals and vegetation     And We shall gather together the whole of mankind and shall not leave out anyone of them  
Or   Who made the earth a dwelling place and made rivers amid it and made for it huge mountains and put a barrier between the two seas   of salt and sweet waters     Is there any   other   God besides Allah   But most of these   disbelievers   do not have knowledge  
And He is the One Who has made you vicegerents in the earth and exalted some of you over others in ranks   so that He may test you by means of   things   which He has bestowed upon you   as a trust     Surely your Lord is swift in awarding punishment   to those who deserve it     but He is indeed Most Forgiving and Ever   Merciful   towards the aspirants to forgiveness    
And   taking him along   he entered his garden   Doing wrong to his soul   by way of arrogance     he said   I do not   even   imagine that this garden will perish  
And in truth   this   revelation has been sent to you and to those   Messengers as well   who were   raised   before you     O man     if you associate partners with Allah then all your works will go to waste and you will certainly be among the losers  
He submitted   This is my stick   I lean on it and beat down leaves with it for my goats   and in it there are also many other benefits for me  
And when the Truth reached them they said   This is magic and we deny it  
They are   green and fresh Gardens   with deep thick branches  
He will say   O my Lord   why have You raised me up blind   today   whereas I had vision   in the world    
O Believers   Do not make friends with those on whom Allah has sent His wrath   Surely they have despaired of the Hereafter as the disbelievers have despaired of those in graves  
Reclining on couches   enjoying the wonderful sights  
And by the human soul and by the One Who provided it with an all   dimensional poise   proportion and perfection  
Which pelted them with stone   hard slugs  
And Hell will be uncovered before the misguided  
And   O my people   this is a   peculiarly created   she   camel of Allah   which   is a Sign for you   So leave her free to graze in Allahs earth and do her no harm lest an imminent torment should seize you  
So that Allah may forgive   for your sake   all the earlier and later sins   of all those people   of your Umma   Community   who struggled   fought and sacrificed by your command     and   this way   may complete His blessing on you   outwardly and inwardly   in the form of Islams victory and forgiveness for your Umma   Community     and may keep   your Umma   firm   footed on th
So that Allah may give them best reward for the   good   deeds they have done and may bestow upon them   still   more out of His Bounty   And Allah blesses with sustenance   and provisions   without measure whom He wills  
And by the Book inscribed  
He alone turns away   from the Holy Messenger and the Quran   who is turned away   from the knowledge of pre   eternity    
We have not heard of this   belief in the Oneness of God   even among the last community   of Christianity or the religion of Quraysh     This is but a fabricated lie  
O our Lord   Indeed whomever You admit to Hell   You have surely humiliated him and the wrongdoers do not have any supporters  
He commands you only to do what is evil and immodest and   also   that you should say about Allah that which you   yourselves   do not know  
And   recall the incident   when your Lord called to Musa   Moses     Go to the wrongdoing people  
Father   Indeed I fear that a torment from Most Kind   Lord   may seize you and you become a companion of Satan  
And soon your Lord shall bestow upon you   so much   that you will be well   pleased  
Then We raised after them another community  
  These hypocrites   swear by Allah that they have not said   anything     whereas they have definitely uttered blasphemy and have become disbelievers after   showing   their belief in Islam   They intended   many tortures too   that they could not achieve   And   out of Islam and the Messengers conduct   they could not disdain anything   except that Allah and His Messenger had ma
And those of the Right Hand   what a class the Right Hand are  
No vision can grasp His Sight but He has encompassed all vision and eyesight   He is the All   Penetrating Viewer   All   Aware  
Kaf   Ha   Ya   Ain   Sad     Only Allah and the Messenger know the real meaning    
Put your hand inside your collar opening   It will come out shining white without any disease   And flex your hand close to your   breast to remove   fear   These two Signs from your Lord are for   sending to   Pharaoh and his courtiers   to observe     Surely they are disobedient people  
And if you ask them   Who sends down water from the sky   then gives life   and freshness   to the earth after its death   they will surely say   Allah   Say   All praise belongs to Allah alone   But most of them do not have sense  
It is   an extremely deep pit of   the fiercely Blazing Fire   of Hell    
Woe to the deniers on that Day  
They are just a worthless army of the armies   of the disbelievers   that is about to be badly defeated at this very place  
And He Who has determined law     phenomena for every creation   and guided it to its way   of sustaining and functioning according to its respective system    
But certainly a party of them is concealing the Truth deliberately  
And   also recall the time   when your Lord announced   this   command   to the Jews   that   Allah   shall be bringing upon them such   one or the other   tyrant as would continue afflicting them with evil hardships till the Day of Resurrection   Surely your Lord is Swift in punishment   and indeed He is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful   as well    
O People   If He wills   He may eliminate you and bring others   in your place   and Allah is All   Powerful to do this  
That will neither   ever   cool nor be pleasing  
Inquire   of them     Is there any of your   so   called   partner   gods that originates creation   then restores it   after total annihilation of life     Say   Allah alone initiates creation   bringing life into existence from nonentity     then He is the One Who will repeat it   as well     So where are you wandering disoriented  
They said   It is all the same to us whether you admonish or do not become of those who admonish   we shall not believe    
Say   I have been commanded to worship Allah in sincerest obedience and devotion to Him alone  
This   Quran   is only direction and guidance for the whole world  
And Allah taught Adam the names of all   things     and then set them before the angels and said   Tell Me the names of these things if you are true   in your assumption    
Nor do I entertain the idea that the Last Hour will take place   And if   supposedly   I am returned to my Lord   even then I shall certainly get a place to return better than these gardens  
Or have you any   such   firm covenants from Us which will subsist till the Day of Resurrection   by means of which We are bound   that you will be provided with whatever you shall decide   for yourselves    
Those who believe in the unseen   and establish prayer   fulfilling all requisites   and spend   in Our way   out of what We have given them  
Then those   residents of Paradise   will turn to one another and mutually inquire   about well   being    
Assuredly this   Quran   is the   God   sent   Commandment of the Exalted and Glorious Messenger     blessings and peace be upon him   which he expounds as a Messenger and as a Vicegerent    
Then their sects began to differ among themselves   So the disbelievers are doomed due to the presence on the Mighty Day   of Resurrection    
And for those who have denied their Lord is the torment of Hell   And what an evil abode it is  
And before it was the Book of Musa   Moses   the Torah       a Guide and Mercy   And this Book confirms that   It is in the Arabic language to warn the wrongdoers and give good news to the pious  
Your greed for massive wealth and the superiority complex has made you negligent   of the Hereafter    
Indeed those whose lives angels take in such a state that   due to living in an environment of injustice   oppression and extremism   they have ruined their souls   the angels ask them   What condition were you in     You neither struggled to promote justice   tolerance and peace nor left for the land of equity and peace     They   regretfully   reply   We were powerless and helpl
  They too were sent   with clear proofs and the Books   And     O Glorious Messenger     We have revealed to you the Glorious Reminder   the Quran   so that you may explain clearly to people   the Message and the Commandments   that have been sent down to them and that they may meditate  
And anyone who worships another god along with Allah has no proof of this   So he will be accountable for that to his Lord alone   Surely   the disbelievers will not be successful  
Hell would truly be   his   abode  
Say     Just   observe what Signs of Allahs Might are there in   the boundless cosmos of   the heavens and the earth     These   Signs and   the Messengers   who warn the people   of Allahs torment   cannot benefit those who have no intension to believe  
That is how Allah seals the hearts of the people who do not know   the Truth    
O Our Lord   You will surely bring together mankind on the Day about which there is no doubt   Verily   Allah does not go against   His   promise  
So   if a person fears any partiality by a testator   for someone   or injustice   towards some other   and then he brings about reconciliation among them   it shall be no sin on him   Verily Allah is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
And there are many Signs in the earth for the people with the truth of certitude   i   e   people of perfect certitude    
And the heart of Musas   Mosess   mother felt empty   of patience     And she would have nearly disclosed the secret   owing to her impatience     had We not energized her heart with the strength of peace and patience   so that she might remain one of the firm believers   in Allahs promise    
Then bind him tightly in a seventy yard long chain  
So remain firm   footed as you have been commanded   and he too   must persevere   who has turned   to Allah   in your companionship   And     O people     do not revolt   Indeed He monitors whatever you do  
  And say     We are feeding you only to please Allah   We do not seek any recompense from you nor   wish for   any thanks  
But those who repent   mend   their   ways and make known   the Truth     so I   too   shall forgive them   And I am Most Relenting   Ever   Merciful  
And had Allah so willed He would have made   all   of you one Umma   Community   but He holds strayed whom He wills and leads to guidance whom He wills   And you will surely be asked about the deeds you used to do  
And We have not taught him   the Holy Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     composing poetry   nor does it befit his dignity   This   Book   is but direction and guidance and the illumining Quran  
So fear Allah and obey me  
And He is the One Who   later     after the creation of the planet sun   separated   from it   the earth   flung it with centrifugal force   and spread its expanse to make it inhabitable    
Then at sunrise they   Pharaohs people   chased them  
And these   polytheists   have taken besides Him other gods which cannot create anything and are themselves created and possess no power either to harm or to benefit themselves and control neither death nor life   nor   have they any authority   to raise up   after death   and assemble  
Have they not seen the birds that fly aloft in the air   under the law of motion and aerodynamics     Nothing but   the laws of   Allah hold them   in the sky     Surely there are Signs in   this law of aerodynamics   for the believers  
Have they not seen that We made the night for them so that they may rest in it and the day sight   giving   to oversee the affairs of life and to make things visible and perceptible     Indeed there are Signs in it for those who believe  
So     O Beloved     if Allah again takes you back to a party of these   hypocrites   after getting free from the battle of Tabuk     and they seek your permission to go forth   for fight in the event of some future conflict     then say to them     Now   you shall never go forth with me   nor shall you ever fight an enemy accompanying me   because   abandoning the sacred struggle
Definitely We know how much the earth   eats up and   consumes their   bodies   and We have a Book wherein everything is preserved  
Their eyes will be cast down   with terror and shame   and disgrace will be spreading over them whereas they were called to prostrate themselves   in the world also   when they were healthy   but they   even then   refused to fall prostrate    
And He has dominance over His servants and He sends to you   angels as   guardians until when death approaches anyone of you   then the angels   We send take his soul and they do not err   or default    
  These privileged servants of Allah are those   who fulfil their vows and keep fearing that Day whose severity spreads afar  
  After proper judicial trial as per law   cut off the hands of both the man as well as the woman who steal   in retribution of   the offence   which they have committed   a deterring punishment from Allah   And Allah is Almighty   Most Wise  
Your wives are for you like a harvest producing field   So   go to your field as you may desire   And manage some provisions for yourselves for the next world   Inculcate in yourselves Allahs fear and be mindful that you have to appear before Him   And     O Beloved     give good news to the believers   that their appearance before Allah will be gainful for them    
  Inscribed   in the very well   guarded tablet al   Lawh   al   Mahfuz  
But the one who does not find   a slave or a slave girl   must fast for two consecutive months   as an obligation   before they touch each other   Then someone who is unable to do that must feed sixty poor people   under obligation     That is in order that you may keep your belief in Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     And these are the limits   set by  
Surely We suffice you for   taking them to task   who scoff  
Say to the believers to disregard those who neither hope for nor fear   the coming of   the Days of Allah   so that He may give them full reward of those   deeds   which they used to earn  
And among them are those who give ears to you   without their heads and hearts in it   till   when they leave your presence and go   out     they ask those who have been given   profitable   knowledge   What is it that he   the Holy Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     just said   It is they whose hearts Allah has sealed up and they are following their lusts  
And whoever comes to His Presence as a believer   and   has   also   done good deeds   it is they for whom are high ranks  
And those   polytheists   have made some of His servants His components   of Divinity by declaring them His children     Verily man is blatantly ungrateful  
Beware   Verily   the friends of Allah will not have any fear   nor will they grieve  
And He is the One Who has created firm mountains in the earth   by allying various elements   lest it tremors while carrying you   revolving in its orbit     and rivers and   also natural   routes so that you may find way   to reach the destinations    
And those who believe and persevere with right actions We shall certainly house them in the upper palaces of Paradise with streams flowing beneath them   they will live there forever   What an excellent reward for those who do   constructive   works  
And I swear by Allah   I shall certainly implement a plan against your idols after you turn back and go away  
He said   O my people   there is not any error in me but   the truth is that   I am   raised as   a Messenger by the Lord of all the worlds  
It is they whose good works We accept and overlook their omissions     It is   they   who   are the people of Paradise   This is the True Promise which is being made to them  
Go to Pharaoh   He has exceeded limits   in defiance and rebellion    
This is the same Hell that was being promised to you  
Know   Whatever is in the heavens and the earth   all   belongs to Allah alone   Beware   Indeed the promise of Allah is true but most of them do not know  
And there are some among them who   apparently   lend you their ears   but will you make the deaf hear even though they do not have a little capability to understand  
And there is nothing that stands in the way of acceptance of their spending   i   e   charity donations   except that they deny Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and come to offer Prayer but lazily and unwillingly and   also   they do not spend   in the cause of Allah   but feeling displeased  
And never think of Allah to be unaware of the works the wrongdoers are doing   He is only giving them   the wrongdoers   respite till the Day on which the eyes will be stare   fixed   in horror    
This is an insignificant possession   for a brief period     Then their abode will be Hell and that is a very evil abode  
And your people have rejected this   Quran   as false whereas it is the Absolute Truth   Say   I am not a guardian over you  
Well   give your view   the water that you drink
The Day when We will seize with the Greatest Seizure     that Day   We shall certainly exact revenge  
And those blessed with knowledge and faith will say   to them     Indeed   according to the Book of Allah   you have stayed till the Day of Resurrection   instead of one hour     So this is the Day of Resurrection but you did not know it  
Have We not made for him two eyes  
And   yet   among these nomads there is   also   one who believes in Allah and the Last Day and considers whatever he spends   in the way of Allah   as a means of nearness to Allah and receiving   merciful   supplications of the Messenger   Listen   Assuredly it is a source of nearness to Allah   Allah will soon admit them to His Mercy   Surely Allah is Most Forgiving   Ever   Mer
And the   layers of   heaven shall be torn and   owing to the rip   they will become   as if   all doors  
Nor is that   Quran   the utterance of any accursed Satan  
It is not Allahs Glory that He should take   to Himself anyone as   a son   Holy and Glorified is He   above this     When He decrees any matter   He only says to it   Be   and it becomes  
  Having accomplished his conquests in the East     he then followed   still another   route  
The hypocrites will surely be in the lowest depth of Hell and you will never find for them any helper  
Beware   You are the ones who love them but they do not   even   like you although you believe in all the Books   When they meet you   they say   We have accepted faith   but when alone   they bite their fingers in rage against you   Say   Perish in your pent   up rage   Certainly Allah knows well the secrets of hearts  
So hold fast to this   Quran   which has been revealed to you   Surely you are   firm   on the straight path  
  O Muslims     When you return to them   from the expedition of Tabuk   they will offer their apologies to you     O Beloved     Say   Do not make excuses   we will not at all believe you   Allah has informed us about your state of affairs   Now   in future   Allah as well as His Messenger will monitor your performance   in the world     Then   in the Hereafter too   you will be 
Do they think that the help We are giving them   in this world   in the shape of wealth and children  
  In fact   you worship none besides Allah except a few names which you and your forefathers have forged   on your own     Allah has not sent down any authority for them   Judgment rests with Allah alone   He alone has commanded that worship none but Him   This is the straight path   true Din   Religion     but most people do not know  
Indeed We offered the Trust   of Obedience   to the heavens and the earth and the mountains   but they declined to bear this   burden   and felt scared of it but man took it on   Verily he is ever so wrongdoing   against his own soul     unwise and extremely ignorant   of the consequence of lapse in paying back the trust    
And they say   Our hearts are in covers against that to which you call us   and in our ears is heaviness   of deafness     and between us and you is a barrier   So you keep doing   your   work and we do our work  
As for those who disbelieved   I shall give them severe punishment   both   in this world and in the Hereafter   and they shall have no helpers  
It sends a hair   raising shudder in the bodies of those who fear their Lord  
And   will Allah make her His offspring for partnership and assistance in His affairs   who will be brought up in trinkets and beautification and who shall never be bold   in giving her opinion expressly   in a contention   owing to her mild   modest and feminine temperament    
Say   I advise you but only one thing   stand up for Allah in twos or singly   warned and spiritually awake     Then meditate   i   e   inspect the reality and introspect   the Truth will dawn on you   that he   the Holy Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     who has honoured you with his companionship is not even touched by any mania   He is but a Warner giving you   tim
So believe in Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and that Light which We have sent down   And Allah is Well Aware of the deeds that you do  
  O Esteemed Beloved     We recite to you from the true account of Musa   Moses   and Pharaoh for those who have believed  
And when you call   the people   to Prayer   by means of the Adhan the call to Prayer     these   people   take it as fun and sport because they are a people who have no sense   at all    
They will say   Glory be to You   It did not become us   even   to take friends other than You   let alone asking them to worship others besides You     But     O Lord     You bestowed upon them and their fathers worldly riches to such an extent that they forgot   even   Your Remembrance   And these were but the   doomed   people to be destroyed  
And when heavens will split apart and will become rosy like burnt oil   or red leather    
And in the   scriptures   of Ibrahim   Abraham   who accomplished   all the Commands of Allah   with perfection  
Then what will be their plight   at that time   when some disaster befalls them on account of their own crooked works   and they will appear before you swearing by Allah     saying     We intended nothing but piety and mutual harmony  
And what have you made out what the Night of Destiny is  
And who has told you what the Day of Judgment is  
And Hell will be made manifest to everyone who can see  
And Sulaiman   Solomon   inspected the birds and said   How is it that I do not see the hoopoe   Or has he   really   vanished  
And We have slung every mans record of deeds around his neck   and on the Day of Resurrection We shall bring forth   this   record which he will find spread out   before him    
And He is the One Who gave you life   then He causes you to die and then will give you life again   No doubt   it is the man who is highly ungrateful  
He has been created from the ejaculated fluid   i   e   virile and motile sperm    
The revelation of this Book is from Allah   the Lord of Honour   All   Wise  
And prostrate yourself before His Presence for some hours of the night and glorify Him during   the rest of   the long hours of the night  
And     O Beloved     you will see the angels all around the Throne in circles glorifying the Lord with His praise and the judgment will be given among   all   the people with the truth and justice and it will be announced   All praise belongs to Allah alone   the Sustainer of all the worlds  
And secrets which are in hearts will be disclosed  
If every evildoer possessed   all   that   wealth   which is in the earth   he would certainly offer it as ransom   to get rid of   the torment     But even then he will not be able to escape from the torment     And when   such people   see the torment   they will conceal their remorse   And judgment will be made among them with justice and they will not be wronged  
These are the Verses of the enlightening Book  
Ibrahim   Abraham   asked   O deputed angels   sent by Allah     what other assignment do you have   to accomplish besides these glad tidings for which you have come    
And the one who makes friends with Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and the believers then   they are the people who are Allahs party     and   it is the people of   Allahs party who will surely overmaster  
And whoever longs for the Hereafter and toils for it befittingly and he is a believer   as well     it is they whose struggle will earn recognition  
But   those   transgressors substituted some other phrase in place of that which was said to them   So We sent down a calamity from heaven on   those   evildoers   in the form of plague   because they were disobeying   persistently    
Except for those really helpless men   women and children who neither are capable to make any plan nor do they know any way   to escape from there    
  O Beloved     Thus We have sent you   as Messenger   to an Umma   Community   before whom in fact   all   the communities have passed     This is now the last of all the communities   so that you may recite to them that   Book   which We have revealed to you   And they are still denying ar   Rahman   the Most Kind Lord     Say   He is my Lord   There is no God but He   In Him ha
Say   to these polytheists     Produce your witnesses who would   come to   testify that Allah has forbidden this   Then if at all they bear   false   witness   do not accept their testimony   but instead   disclose to them their falsehood     Nor yield to the vain desires of those who refuse to accept Our Revelations as true and do not believe in the Hereafter and hold   false go
So that you may not grieve over what goes out of your hands   nor gloat in pride over what He grants you   And Allah does not like anyone arrogant and proud
And Musa   Moses   said   I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant character who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning  
There is no good in most of their secret consultations except only   the counsel   of the person who enjoins charity or piety or peace   making among people   And whoever does this seeking Allahs pleasure   We shall soon bless him with a mighty reward  
And they ask you concerning mountains   So say   My Lord will blow them off as dust particles  
Say   I am forbidden to worship those   false gods   that you worship apart from Allah   Say   I cannot follow your desires   for if I did I would certainly lose the right path   Nor shall I be one of the rightly guided   which is impossible    
And the record of deeds will be placed   before everyone     So   you will see the evildoers terrified at the   sins   wrongs and offences   registered   in the record     And they will say   Oh   woe to us   What is the matter with this record that it has left out neither any insignificant   wrong   nor any big   blunder     It has rather taken into account   each and every act  
On that Day all information will become unknown to them and they will not be able to ask   even   one another  
And towards Madyan   We sent   their   kinship   brother Shuaib   He said   O my people   always worship Allah   you have no God except He   Indeed there has come to you from your Lord a clear sign   So give full measure and weight and do not decrease while giving people their things   nor create mischief in the land after reformation   of the living conditions     This is better 
The maidens who are veiling   confined in tents  
O Lord   Deliver me and my family from   the consequent suffering of   this practice which they are doing  
So thus We revealed to you Our Spirit   of hearts and souls   by Our Command   that is the Quran     And   before Revelation   you did not know what the Book was   nor did you know   through your own endeavour and insight the details of the injunctions of   faith   which were sent down and determined later     But We made it a Light   By means of this Light We give guidance to tho
  All of them   will be gathered together on a fixed Hour of an appointed Day  
And obey the Command of their Lord   with regard to the catastrophic split   up   and   it is this implementation of the Command   that they are bound to do  
And Allah has caused you to grow like vegetation from the earth  
The Day when they will see the angels   there will be no matter of joy for the evildoers anyway on that Day   They will rather say   frightened on seeing them     Would that there were a barricade   which could save us from them   Or the angles   on seeing them   will say   Entry to Paradise is totally forbidden for you    
  Zanjabil   is a spring in this   Paradise   named Salsabil  
And if We have mercy on them and remove the distress that has   afflicted   them   they will become hardened in their transgression wandering disorientated  
So that     O people     you may believe in Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and may help his   Din   Religion       and revere and venerate him heart and soul   and   with that   glorify Allah morning and evening  
What should be your concern in talking about   its appointed time    
And do not entrust to the mentally deficient your   or their   assets which Allah has made a means of stability for your economy   However   feed them out of it and clothe them   and say to them good and nice words  
And I do not demand of you any wages for this   preaching of the Truth     My reward is only with the Lord of all the worlds  
And surely We tried   also   those who were before them   Certainly Allah shall make them prominent   through trial   who are truthful   in claiming belief     and shall make known the liars   as well    
And he will be a Messenger to the Children of Israel     saying to them     I have undoubtedly brought to you a Sign from your Lord   I design for you from clay   a figure   like the shape of a bird   then I breathe into it   and at once it becomes a flying bird by Allahs Command   And I restore to health the born blind   and the lepers   and raise the dead to life by the Command 
One   of the participants in conversation   will say   to the other     There was an acquaintance of mine   who disbelieved in the Hereafter    
And those who give away   in the way of Allah as much   as they can   yet   in spite of that   their hearts fear that they are to return to their Lord   lest it should be rejected    
  The residents of Paradise   will be   sitting   reclining on cushions over green carpets and rare and exquisite fine rugs  
  O Esteemed Messenger     Proclaim   He is Allah   Who is the One  
  Allah said     O Zakariyya   Zacharias     indeed We give you the good news of a son whose name shall be Yahya   John     We have not given this name to anyone before him  
Then We gave Musa   Moses   the Book to complete   the Favour   on him who would become pious   and   revealed it   as explanation of everything and as guidance and mercy   so that they might believe in meeting with their Lord   on the Day of Resurrection    
He torments whom He wills and shows Mercy to whom He pleases   And to Him will you be returned  
And what else are they waiting for except that the angels should come to them or there should reach the command   of torment   from your Lord   Those before them   also   did the same   And Allah did not do them any wrong but they themselves used to wrong their own souls  
Allah is He Who has revealed the Book with the Truth and   also sent down   the balance   of equality and justice     And who has put you on alert perhaps the Last Hour is near  
They ask you about liquor and gambling   Say   Major sin lies in both of them and also some   worldly   profit for the people but their sin is greater than their profit   And they also ask you about what they should spend   Say     Spend   whatever is surplus to your needs   Thus does Allah make His Commandments clear to you so that you may meditate  
Establish the Prayers   Zuhr   Midday     Asr   Afternoon     Maghrib   Sunset   and Isha   Evening     from the declining of the sun till deep darkness of the night   And also   make obligatory   the recitation of Fajr Prayer   for the Quran in Fajr   Dawn   Prayer is attended   by the angels and a state of divine consciousness also permeates    
And We gave Musa   Moses   the Book   the Torah   and made it guidance for the Children of Israel   and enjoined them     Do not take anyone other than Me as Guardian  
  O disbelievers     They have denied what you said   So     now   you can neither avert the torment nor help yourselves   And     listen     whoever of you does injustice We will make him taste mighty torment  
And fear the plague which will not afflict exclusively those who are the tyrants among you   but its victims will also include those who are accomplices in tyranny or who remain indifferent to it     And bear in mind that Allah is Severe in inflicting torment  
And when souls will be united   with their bodies    
And   blessed him   with sympathy and tenderness and purity and virtuousness from Our Kind Presence and he was very Godfearing  
Alif   Lam   Mim     Only Allah and the Messenger know the real meaning    
  Allah   said   Do not fear   I am indeed with you both   I hear and see   all    
Even though all Signs should come to them so much so that they see the painful torment   as well    
So     O Esteemed Beloved     leave Me   to exact revenge   from the one who rejects this Revelation   Now We shall take them   towards disaster   so gradually that they will not perceive it  
Have you not seen those who were forbidden to whisper   Then they started doing the same that they were forbidden to do   And they whisper about sin and revolt and disobedience to the   Holy   Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and when they come to your presence they greet you with the   unbecoming   words with which Allah has not greeted you and say in their hearts   
The Lord of the heavens and the earth and   all   what is between the two   Almighty   Most Forgiving  
And spend   in the way of Allah   out of   the wealth   which We have given you before death approaches one of you and he says   O my Lord   why did You not give me respite for a short while so that I could donate in charity and become one of the pious  
  O Esteemed Beloved     By the Grace of your Lord you are not   at all   insane  
And   nothing   has prevented Us from sending down the Signs   on their demand even now   except that the bygone people denied the same   Signs   Thereupon   they were immediately seized by destruction and were not granted any respite   O Beloved   We do not want to repeat that with your people after We have raised you as Our Messenger     And We gave the people of Thamud an open 
  Azar   said   Ibrahim   Abraham     have you turned away from my gods   If you do not practically desist   from this opposition   I will certainly stone you to death   And keep away from me for a long while  
And they say   When will this promise   of the Last Hour   be fulfilled if you are truthful  
Their sides stay away from their beds and they call out to their Lord in a   mingled state   of fear and hope and spend   in Our Way   out of the sustenance We have provided them  
  That   who it is upon whom comes the torment which will disgrace him   And everlasting torment will come down upon him  
And in this way have We sent down   this last Revealed Book   in the Arabic tongue   in shape of   the Quran and have explained in it more often than not matters inspiring fear   of torment   in diverse ways     so that they may become Godfearing or this   Quran   may inculcate in their   hearts a passion for the acceptance of admonition or   the remembrance   of the Last Day    
And when the news   of the birth   of a daughter is disclosed to any of them   his face turns dark and he gets pent up with anger  
Ha   Mim     Only Allah and the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   know the real meaning    
But repentance is not   accepted   of the people who persist in sinful acts until death overtakes one of them     then   he says   Now I repent   Nor is repentance   of any avail   for those who die as disbelievers   We have prepared grievous torment for them  
And that   some   of us are obedient and   some   of us are wrongdoers as well   So he who becomes obedient   it is they who seek righteousness  
Which floated before Our eyes   under Our security   All this   was done to exact revenge for him Nuh   Noah   who was rejected  
And those who spend their wealth to show off to people   and believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day   And whoever Satan sides with as a companion   so he is an evil companion  
Indeed We pour down water in torrents  
I found her and her people prostrating themselves before the sun instead of Allah   And Satan has made their   evil   deeds highly fascinating for them and has hindered them from the path   of the Oneness of Allah     So they are not getting guidance  
Allahs Messenger said to them   Guard   that   she   camel and   the time of   her taking water  
The only answer of his people was that they said   Drive out the family of Lut   Lot   from your town   they claim to be very pious  
And a small number   among them   will be from the later generations  
Alif   Lam   Ra     Only Allah and the Messenger know the real meanings     It is a   glorious   Book which We have revealed to you so that you may bring mankind out of the darkness   of disbelief   to the light   of faith   And moreover   by the Command of their Lord   lead them   to the path of the Almighty   the Praiseworthy
Then torment him by pouring boiling water over his head  
Have you not seen the hypocrites who say to their brothers among the People of the Book who have become disbelievers   If you are driven out   from here     we too will necessarily leave with you and will never obey anyone in your case   and if you are attacked   we will most certainly help you   But Allah bears witness that they are certainly liars  
When   hearing this matter from one another   you brought it on your tongues and uttered with your mouths something about which you   yourselves   had no knowledge   and you took   propagation of   this matter as inconsiderable   whereas in the Presence of Allah it was a grave   offence underway    
This is a Blessed Book that We have revealed to you so that the wise may ponder over its Verses and seek direction and guidance  
Your riches and your children are merely a trial   And there is a mighty reward in the Presence of Allah  
And also of their ancestors and descendants and their brothers   We honoured some with similar excellence   and We chose them   for Our special favour and eminence   and guided them to the straight road  
And they say     This Quran comprises   fables of the ancients which this man has got written   then these   fables   are recited to him morning and evening   in order to memorize and narrate further    
Surely We alone raise the dead alive   And We are writing down   the deeds   which they have sent forward and their effects   that are left behind     And We have encompassed everything in the illumining Book   al   Lawh al   Mahfuz    
This is a Day   on which   they will not be able to speak too  
And likewise   silver   doors of their houses and the couches   too   on which they recline  
  This   is sent down by the Lord of all the worlds  
The people of Thamud rejected   their Messenger Salih   due to their rebellion  
And had We not   already   made you firm   footed   through holiness and impeccability of Prophethood     even then you   owing to your holy and sanctified self and natural potential   would have but trivially gone near to inclining towards them     You would not have even then bent much towards them and they would have failed   But Allah has protected you from even nearing such a
And   of the animal world   vegetable world and minerals   whatever He has created for you in the earth which have separate colours   genders   species   classes   characteristics and benefits   etc   all have been subdued to your service     Verily   there is a Sign in it for those who take advice  
So eat and drink and cool   your   eyes   with the sight of your beautiful   lovely baby     Then if you see any man   say   to him by gestures     I have vowed a fast   of silence   to the Most Gracious   Lord     so I shall just not talk to any human being today  
And the true promise   of the Day of Resurrection   will draw near   then the eyes of the disbelievers will suddenly fix staring   and they will cry out     Woe to us   We were indeed oblivious of   the arrival of   this   Day     in fact we were unjust  
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     Then if you turn away   remember that   the responsibility of Our Messenger is only to deliver   the injunctions   clearly  
That is but the limit of the working of their knowledge   Verily your Lord fully knows him who has strayed from His path and   also   knows best him who has attained guidance  
Do they not know that Allah Who created the heavens and the earth and was not tired by creating them has   also   the power to bring the dead back to life   again     Yes   of course   He has power over everything  
They will inherit   also   the most superior Gardens of Paradise   where all the bounties   comforts and pleasures of nearness to Allah will abound     They will live there forever  
And your Lord will unveil His Light and the angels will appear   before His Presence   rank upon rank  
Musa   Moses   said to his people   Seek help from Allah and be steadfast   surely the earth belongs to Allah   He makes its inheritors whom He likes of His servants   And it ends well for the Godfearing alone  
Can the Creator Who creates   all that   be like the one who cannot create   anything     Do you not then accept advice  
Verily in this   occurrence   there are Signs for those who possess the ability to probe into reality  
And there are some of the people who dispute about Allah   His Essence   Attributes and Powers   without knowledge and understanding   and without any guidance and logic   and without any enlightening Book   sent down from heaven    
Allah will judge between you on the Day of Judgment all those matters in which you used to disagree  
They produced Yusufs   Josephs   shirt smearing it   also   with false blood     Yaqub   Jacob     said     This is not the truth     But your   jealous   ill   commanding   selves have made   a colossal   task easy and pleasant   looking for you   which you eventually did accomplish     So better it is to be steadfast   over this tragedy     and I seek only Allahs help against wh
And surely We keep distributing this   rain   among them   on the scale of different times and cities   so that they may contemplate   Even then most people did not accept   anything   except ingratitude  
So   how ill   fated is he that   he neither affirmed   what the Messenger said   nor offered Prayer  
Verily this   Quran   is an admonition   So let him who desires adopt the way to reach his Lord  
  He alone is   the Lord of both the easts and   He alone is   the Lord of both the wests  
And if they had only been patient till you had come out to them   it would have been better for them   And Allah is Most Kind   Ever   Merciful  
The people of Nuh   Noah also   rejected the Messengers  
  O Beloved     Indeed We have sent Revelation to you as We sent it to Nuh   Noah   and   other   Messengers after him   and We also sent Revelation to Ibrahim   Abraham     Ismail   Ishmael     Ishaq   Isaac     Yaqub   Jacob   and   his   children and Isa   Jesus     Ayyub   Job     Yunus   Jonah     Harun   Aaron   and Sulaiman   Solomon     and We conferred the Zabur   Book of
The fact is that We have brought them the Truth and they are liars without any doubt  
And in some part of the night   as well   rising from sleep     offer the Tahajjud Prayer with the Quran   This is added especially for you   Your Lord will certainly raise you to a station of praise and glory   i   e   the glorious station of intercession where all the former and later generations will turn towards you and glorify you    
Surely there has passed over man a period of time when he was not a thing worth mentioning  
  They do not realize that   We alone have created them and have made their every joint strong   and We can replace them whenever We may please with the people like them  
That is how We pay back those who are committed to spiritual excellence  
That you must worship Allah and fear Him and obey me  
That Day We shall ask Hell   Are you filled up   And it will say   Is there any more  
And when the time to execute Our Command   of torment   against them comes   We shall bring out for them from the earth a beast who will converse with them because people do not place certitude in Our Signs  
It is they whose abode is Hell   a recompense for the deeds they used to earn  
These are the Revelations of Allah which We recite to you with Truth   And Allah intends no injustice to mankind  
Then We seized the people of Pharaoh with   the torment of   some years   of famine   and scarce yield of fruits so that they might be admonished  
And how many a people have We destroyed before them who were better off   than these   in worldly assets and pomp and show  
This is so because Allah has sent down the Book with the Truth   And indeed those who fabricate contradictions   and antinomies   in the Book are far   gone from the Truth   in rivalry  
And   also   talk of piety to the common people   in a polite and nice manner     And establish Prayer and pay on Zakat   the Alms   due    
And He shows you   many of   His Signs   So which of Allahs Signs will you deny  
And He Who has brought forth green pasture   from the earth    
Then   after a while   one of those two   girls   came to him walking modestly   She said   My father invites you so that he may reward you for   your labour in   watering   the flocks   for us   So when Musa   Moses   came to   Shuaib   the father of those girls     and narrated to him   the preceding   incidents   he said   Do not fear   You are safe and secure from the oppressi
So   the inmates of Paradise will gladly ask     Shall we not die now  
And     in truth   the matter is that   it is not Allahs Glory to torment them while     O Venerable Beloved     you are also   present   among them   Nor will Allah torment them while they are engaged in supplicating Him for forgiveness  
And if they reject you   many Messengers have been rejected before you   And all matters will be returned to Allah alone  
And numerous faces there will be covered with dust that Day  
Or should say   If Allah had given me guidance   I would certainly have been of the righteous  
It is most hateful in the sight of Allah that you should say what you do not do  
And never be of those who deny the Revelations of Allah lest you should become of the losers  
Then when he came to them with the message of Truth from Us   they said   Kill the sons of those who have believed with him but leave their women alive   And the treacherous plots of the disbelievers were nothing but ruination  
And those who believed and emigrated and fought in the cause of Allah and those who provided shelter   to those who sacrificed their households and homeland in the cause of Allah   and helped   them   are the people who are in fact true Muslims   They are the ones for whom is forgiveness and an honourable provision  
Indeed there is for you an excellent example in them   to follow     for him   in particular   who hopes   to appear before the Presence of   Allah and looks forward to the Last Day   But whoever turns away then Allah is Self   Sufficient and Praiseworthy  
O Believers   Do not be like those who hurt Musa     Moses   by means of their denigrating words     So Allah proved him clear of the blames which they levelled against him   And he   Musa   Moses     had great honour and high standing in the sight of Allah  
And who has told you what Saqar   the Fire of Hell   is  
That proceeds from the middle of the sacrum   and pelvic girdle   and gets ejected  
The true believers are only those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and then never get into doubt   and who fight in the way of Allah with their material as well as human resources   It is they who are true   in their claim to believe    
Then by those which split   them   apart and break them off  
To repulse them   And for them is eternal torment  
The Day when the torment wraps them from above them and from beneath their feet Allah will say   Savour the taste of works you used to perform  
Then Adam learnt some words   of humility and repentance   from his Lord   So Allah accepted his repentance   Surely He is the One Who is Most Relenting   Ever   Merciful  
  The Messengers   said   Your evil omen is with you   Is it an evil omen that you are admonished   Nay   but you are a people who exceed limits  
And We blessed Dawud   David   with   a son   Sulaiman   Solomon     How excellent a servant was he   He is indeed oft   returning to Allah in repentance  
He will forgive your sins and will give you respite till an appointed term   Surely when   the appointed   time of Allah comes then respite is not given if only you knew  
These are the Revelations of Allah which We recite to you with absolute Truth   Then what will they believe in after Allah and His Revelations  
And the Mercy of your Lord is better than that   wealth   which they amass   and become arrogant    
Nor can you guide the blind   of heart   rescuing them   from their wrong path     In fact   you make hear only those who   accepting your call   believe in Our Revelations   So it is they who are Muslims   and only they deserve to be called alive    
Indeed those who conceal   those verses of the Torah   which Allah has revealed and take in exchange for that a small price eat nothing but fill their bellies with Fire   And Allah will not even speak to them nor purify them on the Day of Resurrection   And for them is painful torment  
But those who believe and do good works persistently   We do not burden anyone beyond his endurance   it is they who are the people of Paradise   they will live in it forever  
Then when they will see that   Day   near   the faces of the disbelievers will be deformed and turned black and it will be said   to them     This is   the promise   which you asked for   to come to pass in haste    
We have created them both with   the purpose and reason   of Truth   But most of them do not know  
And he whom Allah holds misguided   i   e   leaves astray   has no one to guide him  
But   the wrongdoers go so far as to   say   This   Quran   comprises   things seen in   confused dreams   Nay   He has invented it   himself     Nay   he is   in fact   a poet     If he is a true Prophet     let him   also   bring us some Sign as were former   Prophets   sent   with Signs    
And We explained examples to each one   of them for direction and guidance     but   when they did not refrain from rebellion   We wiped them off completely  
Indeed   your Lord is Ever   Watchful   over the tyrant rebels    
Half the night or decrease it a little  
So fear Allah and obey me  
And they did not break up into factions but only after knowledge had reached them merely on account of their mutual obstinacy   and stubbornness     And had the Command of your Lord not gone forth concerning   respite   for an appointed time   the judgment would have been given between them   And verily those who were made inheritors of the Book after them are   caught   themselve
  The disbelievers   ask you about the Hour of Rising   When will it come to pass  
So   when Talut   Saul   marched out of the city with his troops   he said   Surely   Allah will try you by means of a stream   So he who drinks from it will not be   of my companions     and he who does not drink it will be of   my party     but if someone takes   only   a sip of it from the hollow of his hand     there is no harm    
So that you may move around through its broad ways  
And verily it is   also mentioned   in the scriptures of former communities  
And We admitted Lut   Lot   to the fold of Our Mercy   Truly he was of the pious  
Allah said     Be off     you are surely of those who are granted respite  
The humble will then say to the conceited   Nay   it was   your   deceptive scheming night and day   that hindered us   when you used to order us to disbelieve in Allah and assign equals to Him   And they will hide their pang of guilt   from one another   when they will see the torment   And We will put iron collars round the necks of the disbelievers and they will be recompensed 
Do you argue with him about what he saw  
And Allah created the heavens and the earth with   a strategy based on   Truth in order that every soul is rewarded for the deeds that it earns and they will not be wronged  
Whereas He has created you through diverse conditions  
Then he pondered   over his scheme again    
Those who spread destructive activities in the land and do not do constructive works   for society    
And We alone made   the surface of the   earth a   livable   floor   So how graciously We make up and spread out  
This   sending of the Messengers   was because your Lord would not destroy the towns due to injustice while the people living there were   absolutely   unaware   of the teachings of the Truth i   e   no one made them acquainted with the Truth    
He has prescribed for you the same path of Din   Religion   which He enjoined on Nuh   Noah   and which We have revealed to you   and which We enjoined on Ibrahim   Abraham   and Musa   Moses   and Isa   Jesus   And all it denotes is   that hold fast to the same Din   Religion   and do not make divisions in it   That   Oneness of Allah   to which you call them is quite hard for th
Both these gardens yielded   abundant   fruits and their   produce   did not fall short of the mark   And We   also   made one stream flow in the middle of   each of   the two  
So run towards Allah   Surely I am a clear Warner to you from Him  
And had the   Holy   Truth   Allah   followed their vain desires then   all   the heavens and the earth and whatever   living and non   living things   are therein   all would have been destroyed   We have rather brought them that   Quran   which contains   the secret of   their honour   dignity   and fame     So it is from their own honour that they are turning away  
It is they who have purchased error for guidance and torment for forgiveness   What has made them steadfast to bear the Fire   of Hell    
Then I called them aloud  
  O Beloved     As your Lord brought you forth from your home   to fight   for   the great cause of   Truth while a section of the believers was unhappy   about it    
Indeed I   have come as   a trustworthy Messenger to you  
And We have indeed put forth in the Quran repeatedly for mankind every kind of example   alternating the styles   but man is far ahead in contention than anything else  
That people may understand   easily   what I say  
Then they will be cast into Hell  
  These disobedient people are those   who break the promise of Allah after having confirmed it   and break that   relationship   which Allah has ordered to join   and create disorder in the land   It is they who are the losers  
Then   when he   Aziz of Egypt   saw his shirt and found it torn from behind   he said   This is the craft of you women   Certainly your women   craft is highly   dangerous    
And that   guarding against every falsehood     with focused attention     keep your direction towards Din   Religion   and never be of those who associate partners with Allah  
And Allah pours down water from the sky and by means of that brings the earth to life   i   e   makes it fertile and green   after it has become dead   i   e   barren and infertile     Surely there is in it a Sign for those who give ear   to advice    
  Shall we be given life even   when we shall have become rotten   hollow   bones  
He was commanded   O Nuh   Noah     get down   from the Ark   with peace and blessings from Us on you and on the   kingdoms   classes and   species that are with you   And there will   also   be   classes and   species   in future again   whom We shall provide with   the worldly favours     then a painful torment will come upon them from Us  
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth   And no doubt We enjoined those   too   who were given the Book before you and   have ordained   you   as well   to keep fearing Allah   But if you disobey   then assuredly whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth   all   belongs to Allah   and Allah is Beyond All Needs   Ever   Praisewort
O my Lord   Bless me with excellence in knowledge and deeds   and include me among those who deserve Your exceptional intimacy  
Has   this fact   not guided them as to how many people We destroyed before them in whose dwelling places they   now   walk about   Undoubtedly   in this are   many   Signs for the wise  
And they say   If the Most Kind had intended   we would not have worshipped these   idols     They do not know anything about this   as well     They only tell lies out of fancy  
Surely those who do not believe in the Hereafter give the angels female names  
And in like manner We revealed the Book to you   And those   gnostics of the Truth   whom We had given the Book   already   believe in this   Book     And of these   inhabitants of Makka too   there are those who believe in it   And none but the disbelievers deny Our Revelations  
Accept and submit to the Command of your Lord before the Day comes for which there is no averting from Allah   There will be no shelter for you on that Day   Nor will there be any possibility for you to deny  
O believers   Recall Allahs favour to you when the forces   of disbelievers   came upon you   Then We sent wind and troops   of angels   against them whom you did not see   And Allah sees best what you do  
  No     but they say   Indeed we found our fathers following a course   and a religion     and surely we are rightly guided   following   in their footsteps  
And with regard to Din   Religion     who can be better than whoever submits his whole being entirely to Allah while he also holds spiritual excellence   and persistently follows Din   Religion   of Ibrahim   Abraham   a devotee   to Allah and   upright   And Allah had taken Ibrahim   Abraham   for a sincere and intimate friend     So   he also becomes Allahs friend by virtue of h
And if they come to you as captives   you ransom their release   so that they remain obliged to you   whereas it had been forbidden to you to exile them from their homeland  
And verily We delivered the Children of Israel from a humiliating suffering  
Have you not seen these   hypocrites   who claim   verbally   that they believe in this   Book i   e   the Quran     which has been revealed to you and also in those   revealed Books   which were sent down before you     But   they desire to take their disputes   for settlement   to Satan   i   e   the law based on defiance against Allahs Commandments   although they have been ord
  Is it not the fact that   I am better than this worthless low man who cannot even talk clearly  
Say   All praise be to Allah and peace be upon His Servants whom He has Chosen   and Exalted     Is Allah better or those   false gods   that these people associate   with Him    
Verily   Allah is my Lord and your Lord too   So worship Him alone   This is the straight path  
Only those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day and whose hearts are in doubt will seek leave   exemption from fighting   from you   So in their doubt they are bewildered   lost in disorientation  
Do they not think over the Quran or are their hearts locked  
And We informed Lut   Lot   of this judgment through Revelation that the root of these people shall be cut off the moment it dawns  
And there is not a community   comprising disbelievers and the denying rebels   but We shall destroy it before the Day of Resurrection or afflict it with most severe torment   This   decree   is written in the Book   the Protected Tablet   al   Lawh al   Mahfuz      
That is   the Command     And whoever venerates the things sanctified before   the Presence of   Allah that is better for him in the sight of his Lord     All   the cattle   i   e   quadrupeds   are made lawful for you except those whose prohibition has been recited to you   So always keep away from the filth of idols and guard yourselves against telling lies  
And   after you pass through   leave the river still and split open   Surely they are an army who will be drowned  
And there is also a variety of   torments of   similar nature  
It is they who will be the inheritors   of Paradise    
They are just waiting for the angels   of torment   to reach them   or your Lord to come   Himself     or some   exclusive   Signs of your Lord to come   perceptibly   Tell them     The Day when some Signs of your Lord will come   in such an evident way   then accepting   the belief will not benefit someone who had not believed before   or did not earn any good   in the state of  
And they hinder   others from following   this   Messenger and the Quran   and   also themselves   flee far away from it   They ruin but their own souls and have no awareness   of this destruction at all    
Then followed their pathetic successors who gave up Prayers and followed lusts   of their ill   commanding selves     So they will soon face punishment in the Hereafter   in the Ghayi valley of Hell    
Assuredly you will not be able to overpower those who are My servants   and your Lord is Sufficient to protect and help these   friends of Allah    
He alone sends down the angels by His Command with Revelation   which is the spirit of all the teachings of Din   Religion     to those of His servants He likes   Warn   the people   that there is no God except Me   so adopt fearing Me against all evils  
So he   Sulaiman   Solomon     smiled   feeling amused at the ants words   and submitted   O Lord   keep me by Your bestowal firm on it that I remain ever   thankful for Your favour which You have conferred on me and on my parents   and I do such pious deeds as You are pleased with   and admit me by Your mercy among your pious slaves enjoying exceptional nearness to You  
And     O Muslims     in the same way We made you the best Umma   Community fair to all with a tolerant   moderate and balanced outlook   so that you may bear witness to the people   and   Our exalted   Messenger bears witness to you  
They have varying grades in the sight of Allah and Allah thoroughly observes their acts  
Do they seek to hasten Our punishment  
So We delivered him and his entire family  
This is indeed a decisive   absolute   Commandment  
  It will be said to them     Relish food and drink as reward of the   pious   deeds which you used to do  
And those burning in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell   Pray to your Lord that He may lessen our torment some day  
O Believers   Fulfil   your   promises   The quadrupeds   i   e   cattle   have been made lawful for you except those   animals   that will be announced to you afterwards     But   when clad in Ihram   the Pilgrims sacred dress     do not presume hunting lawful   Surely Allah ordains what He wills  
  He is the One   Who spread out the earth for you as a floor   and erected the sky as a mansion   and showered water from the sky and brought forth with that   a variety of   fruits for your nourishment  
So is it this Revelation that you disdain  
They said     We do not know that   but we found our fathers doing the same  
Certainly this is the very Hell you used to doubt  
O our Lord   Grant us all that You have promised us through Your Messengers and do not humiliate us on the Day of Resurrection   Surely   You do not go against Your promise  
They are the ones from whom you took promise   many a time     but they break their promise every time and do not fear   Allah    
And when the Holy Prophet   blessings and peace be upon him   secretly disclosed a matter to one of his wives but when she mentioned it and Allah made it known to the Prophet   blessings and peace be upon him     then the Prophet reminded her of some part of it and overlooked   to inform   the rest of it   Then when the Prophet   blessings and peace be upon him   informed her of i
To Allah belongs the kingdom of all the heavens and the earth and whatever lies in them   and He wields full power over everything  
And most of them do not believe in Allah   but that they are polytheists  
How can you deny Allah whereas you were lifeless and He gave you life   then He will cause you to die and will again bring you back to life   and then to Him will you be returned  
They are those who were unjustly expelled from their homes simply because they said   Our Lord is Allah     i   e   they refused to accept the evil rule     And had Allah not been repelling one class of human society by the other   through progressive struggle and revolutionary toil     the cloisters   synagogues   churches and mosques   i   e   religious centres and worship place
And the chiefs and capitalists of his people   who had disbelieved   and denied the Truth     said   O people   if you follow Shuaib then you will surely be the losers  
Well   for what Day is the term   of all the affairs   appointed  
So Musa   Moses     anxious and afraid   kept waiting till morning   to discover what would happen next     Then suddenly the man who sought his help the day before was crying out to him for help   again     Musa   Moses   said to him   Surely you are the one who has truly lost the right path  
They said   Who has done this to our gods   Surely he is of the wrongdoers  
And   recall   when We took a firm promise from you and raised the Mount of Sinai high above you   so that you hold fast firmly what We have given you   And bear in mind whatever is   written   in this   Book   the Torah     so that you become pious  
And by the night when its darkness tapers off  
  Musa   Moses     said   Rather you cast down   Then the sight was that suddenly their cords and rods   by the effect of their magic   seemed to Musa   Moses   as if they were slithering   on the ground    
I called them neither   for assistance or witness   on the creation of the heavens and the earth   nor   at the time of   their own creation   Nor was it My Glory to take the inciters of misguidance as   My   supporters  
Falsehood can approach it   the Quran   neither from before nor from behind     It   has been sent down by the Most Wise   the Most Praiseworthy   Lord    
They said   These two are really magicians who have the intention to drive you out of your land with sorcery and put an end to your exemplary culture and religion  
And also there is   a Sign of warning   in the   destruction of   the people of Thamud when they were told   Take benefit for an appointed term  
He is the One Who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and Din   Religion   of Truth so that He may make it dominate and prevail over all other religions   even though the idolaters may hate it much  
And We do not send Messengers but as Bearers of glad tidings and as Warners   So whoever believes and changes into a righteous person   practically     they will have nothing to fear   nor will they grieve  
What is   it   they are questioning about one another  
And all praise be to Allah alone   the Lord of all the worlds  
And the preceding communities also denied   the Truth     And they have not yet attained to even one tenth of what We granted them   i   e   the bygone people     But they too denied My Messengers   So how   awful   did My denial   proved   to be  
So you will soon recall   these words   that I am saying to you   And I consign my affair to Allah   Surely Allah is Ever   Watchful of the servants  
  O Esteemed Beloved     We shall teach you   in a way   that nothing shall you   ever   forget  
The people against whom the Command   of torment   has been proved will say   O our Lord   it is these people who we misguided   We led them astray   the same way   as we   ourselves   lost the right path   We turn to You showing our disgust towards them and   in fact   they did not worship us     They rather worshipped their lusts    
The hypocrites feel scared that a Sura   chapter   will be sent down to the Muslims and that will make them aware of those matters that are   hidden   in the hearts   of the hypocrites     Say   Continue mocking   Surely Allah is about to reveal that   matter   which you are scared of  
Say   I do not possess any power to do you harm   make you disbelieve   or to do you good   i   e   make you believe   So Allah is the real Lord   I am a mediator and means    
They liked that they would be with those women   children and the handicapped who would stay behind   And their hearts have been sealed   so they do not understand anything  
And this   beverage of Paradise   will be mixed with the water of Tasnim  
He will say   Would that I had sent   something   ahead of me for my   real   life   which would have helped me today    
  He   is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between the two   So worship Him and remain steadfast in His worship   Do you know who is His namesake  
And say   All praise belongs to Allah alone Who has neither taken any son   for Himself   nor is there any partner in   His   kingdom and regime and nor has He any aide due to any handicap     O Beloved     keep extolling His Greatness and Glory with conviction and magnify Him with all His magnificence  
No one except Allah can bring it forth   and establish    
We will soon show them Our Signs all around the world and in their own selves   until it dawns upon them that indeed this is the Truth   Is your Lord not Sufficient   to confirm your Trueness     for He alone is   also   witness to everything  
Except those who repent and mend   their   ways   Allah is   indeed   Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
So he made a fool of his people   by these utterances   and they followed him   Indeed they alone were a disobedient people  
  Allah said     This is Our Bestowal     Whether you   confer   it   on others or hold back   to you     no account will be asked for   in both the cases    
He admits whom He wills to   the circle of   His Mercy and He has prepared a grievous torment for the wrongdoers  
Return to your Lord in such a state that you are both the aspirant to and the aspired of His pleasure   i   e   you seek His pleasure and He seeks yours    
  The people of the city   said   An evil omen has reached us from you   If you do not desist   we shall certainly stone you and you will definitely suffer an agonizing punishment at our hands  
They said   We shall hold fast to its   worship   until Musa   Moses   comes back to us  
Verily Allah alone causes the seed   grain and the fruit   stone to burst forth and sprout   He brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living   Such is Allah   the Glorious     then where do you stray away  
Two springs are flowing in both of them  
And He gives him sustenance from a source which he can never think of   And whoever puts his trust in Allah then He   Allah   is Sufficient for him   Surely Allah accomplishes His work entirely   He has certainly appointed a measure for everything  
So keep patience   Assuredly the Promise of Allah is true   And ask forgiveness for the sins of your Umma   Community   and glorify your Lord with His praise in the evening and in the morning  
So she adopted veiling from them   the family and the people so that the Absolute Divine Beauty unveils Himself     Then We sent Our Spirit   the angel   Jibrail   Gabriel     towards her who appeared before her in the complete form of a human being  
If you stretch forth your hand against me to kill me     even then   I shall not stretch out my hand against you in order to kill you because I fear Allah   the Sustainer of all the worlds  
And if We had sent it down to any of the non   Arabs  
Then We drowned the others   i   e   Pharaoh and his people    
No doubt   these   inmates of Hell   lived luxuriously before this   in the world    
Then Pharaoh chased them with his troops   So   the   waves of the   river swept over them as much as they covered them up  
And never have We destroyed any township but that there was for them a known inscription   law   which they violated and met their fate    
And the disbelievers say   You are not a Messenger   Say   Sufficient is Allah as a Witness between you and me   on my Messengership     and so also is the one who   exactly   possesses the knowledge of the   revealed   Book  
  Greeting and felicitating them   they will say     Peace be upon you as a reward for your patience   So   see now   what a beautiful home it is of the Hereafter  
Say   Bring some   other   book from Allah which guides better than these two     then   I shall follow that if you are truthful   in your blames    
And as for the people of Thamud   We showed them the path of guidance   but they preferred blindness to Guidance   So a blast of humiliating devastation seized them for the deeds that they used to earn  
  O you who abstain from the armed struggle due to fear of death     Death will overtake you wherever you may be     even   if you are in unconquerable fortresses   And   this is their mentality that   if some good fortune   benefit   comes to them   they say   It is from Allah   i   e   intermediation and benevolence of the Messenger has no role in it     and if some adversity be
In fact Our Command has proved true against most of them   So they will not believe  
And   recall   when We cast the shade of clouds over you   in the Tiha valley   and sent down for you manna and quails so that you might eat of the pure things We provided for you   So they did not harm Us at all   by disobeying and showing Us disregard   but harmed persistently their own souls  
And do not lose heart nor feel grieved   and it is you who will be victorious   provided you maintain   perfect   faith  
Say   O People of the Book   Do not unjustly exceed limits in your Din   Religion     nor follow the desires of those who lost the straight path   before Muhammads Prophethood   blessings and peace be upon him     and   also   caused a number of   others   to go astray and remained deviated from the straight road   even after Muhammads Prophethood   blessings and peace be upon him
Has the account of Musa   Moses   reached you  
Then   after them   We sent Musa   Moses   and Harun   Moses and Aaron   with Our Signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs   But they displayed arrogance and they were people given to crimes

And   recall the time   when We said to the angels   Prostrate yourselves before Adam   in veneration     So they all prostrated themselves except Iblis   He   Iblis   was of the jinn and he walked out of the obedience to his Lord   Are you taking him and his offspring for friends leaving Me whereas in truth they are your enemies   How evil a substitute the evildoers   have opted

And have the disbelievers not seen that the whole heavenly universe and the earth were   all   joined together as one unit and then We split them apart   And We originated   the life of   living organism   on earth   from water   So do they not accept faith   even after learning these facts brought forth by the Quran    
Then if they   also   believe the way you have believed in Him   then they will   surely   be guided aright   And if they turn away then   be clear   that they are sunk in sheer enmity   So Allah is sufficient to guard you against their evil and He is All   Hearing   All   Knowing

Then He turned towards the heavenly universe that was   all   smoke   So He said to it   the heavenly spheres   and the earth   Get in   compliance with Our system   either under the influence of mutual attraction and coordination or under aversion and revulsion   Both said   We submit with pleasure

They will abide in it till the heavens and the earth   which will then exist   last except as your Lord wills   Surely your Lord executes what He wills  
Which revolve freely     then   hide   after appearing    
And the disbelievers say   We shall not believe in this Quran or in that   Revelation   at all which came before it   And if you could see when the wrongdoers shall be made to stand before their Lord     what a spectacle would that be     Everyone of them will be putting the blame back on others   The humble will say to the conceited   Had you not been there we would certainly hav
So when that   messenger   came to Sulaiman   Solomon he   said   to him   i   e   the messenger       Do you want to help me with wealth   whereas what Allah has given me is better than this   wealth   which He has given you   It is rather you who take pleasure   and   pride in your gifts  
He knows that you just do not have the power to encompass it so He granted you forgiveness   by reducing the toil    
And he gave away a little   wealth in the way of Allah   and   then   held back   his hand    
And indeed We are bound to return to our Lord  
So they are made to rush on in their footsteps  
And when the Quran is recited to them   they do not fall down prostrate   before Allah    
Who taught man   reading and writing   by the pen  
And they worship these   idols   besides Allah for which He has not sent down any authority   Nor do they have any knowledge of   the consequence of   this   idol   worship     And there will be no helper of the wrongdoers   on the Day of Judgment    
Displaying haughtiness and arrogance against it   you used to utter absurdity in the darkness of night  
This is the guidance of Allah whereby He guides those of His servants whom He wills   But   if   supposedly   they had associated partners with Allah   all their   pious   deeds that they performed would have been seized   i   e   become void    
And how many towns there were   the inhabitants of   which disobeyed and revolted against the command of their Lord and His Messengers   So We called them to account in the shape of fierce accountability and seized them with such a severe torment as was never seen or even heard of  
There will be their   sighing and wailing   a   roar of screaming in it and they will not be able to hear in it anything   else    
So Allah will save them from the terror of that Day   for their fear of Allah   and will grant them freshness   bloom and blush   on their faces   and ecstasy and delight   in their hearts    
Surely Allah is All   Powerful to do everything  
There is certainly a sign for you in the two parties that encountered each other   in the battlefield of Badr   one party fought in the cause of Allah and the other comprised the disbelievers   They saw them with their   own   eyes as twice their own number   And Allah provides strength with His reinforcement whom He likes   In this incident there is surely a   notable   lesson of
They   who fight in the cause of Allah   do not spend any amount small or great   nor do they journey through a valley but that   all this expense and journey   is written down for them so that Allah may confer on them the best reward   for every such act   that they used to do  
He used to say   to me     Are you   also   of those who confirm and firmly believe   in these things    
And   as   an Inviter towards Allah by His Command and as a Sun spreading Light  
Have they not reflected that the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     who honours them with   his   companionship   has not contracted any mania   He is only a plain Warner   to the disobedient    
  Even   then if they repent and establish Prayer and pay Zakat   the Alms   due   they are your brothers in Din   Religion     And We elucidate   Our   Revelations in detail for those who possess knowledge and understanding  
Say   Had there been angels   instead of human beings   walking about   residing in the earth   then We   too   would have certainly sent down from heaven some angel as a Messenger  
The thunder   of clouds and lightning or the angel appointed over it   and all angels glorify Him with His Praise out of His fear   And He sends thunderbolts and strikes with them whom He wills   And they   the disbelievers   despite these Signs of His Might     dispute about Allah   And He is Stern in strategy and Severe in grip  
And if you divorce them before you have touched them after you have fixed a dower for them   then paying half of the dower you have fixed is necessary   unless they forgo   their right   themselves   or the   husband   in whose hand is the marriage tie forgoes   i   e   pays more than half or full     And     O male folk     if you forgo   that is closer to God   wariness   And ne

Until he reached   a place   between two mountains   He found a people dwelling behind these mountains   They were unable to understand   anyones   speech

The Day when He will gather you on the Day of Assembly   in the vast expanse for Great Gathering     that will be the Day of Manifestation of Loss and Defeat   And he who believes in Allah and does pious deeds   Allah will remove his sins from his   record of deeds   and will admit him to the Gardens with streams flowing under them   They will live in them forever   This is a grea
  O man     Have you not seen that Allah showered water from the sky   then made it sprout from the earth as water springs   Then He brings forth with it crops of various colours   Then   growing fully   it dries up   Then     ripening     you see it turns yellow   Then He reduces it to broken straw   Surely there is advice in it for the wise  
And do not   ever   think that those who are slain in the way of Allah are dead   They are rather alive in the Presence of their Lord   They are served with sustenance   comprising bounties of Paradise    
And assuredly you are placed high on the Most Glorious and Exalted   seat of   Character   i   e   adorned with the Quranic morality and endowed with the character traits of Allah    
So   if someone contends with you about Isa   Jesus   after knowledge has come to you   say   Come   let us   jointly   call our sons and your sons   our women and your women and ourselves and yourselves   at the same place     Then we supplicate fervently   i   e   most submissively   and invoke the curse of Allah upon the liars  
And he   himself   puts forth examples for Us and has forgotten   the truth of   his creation   He says   Who will give life to bones when they will have been decomposed  
This is Our record that will speak about you with absolute truth   Verily We used to   preserve   by getting transcribed what you used to do  
And Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide them to the right path  
  And they submit     O our Lord   let not our hearts deviate after You have honoured us with guidance and grant us Mercy especially from Your Presence   Truly You alone are the Great Bestower  
  Even   then if they turn away   We have not sent you with any responsibility for   saving   them   from destruction     You are responsible only to convey   the Message of Truth     And verily when We make man taste   the savour   of Mercy from Our Presence   he feels pleased   But when some misfortune reaches them owing to the   evil   deeds sent ahead by their own hands then n
And Pharaoh and those before him and   the dwellers of   the overthrown towns   of the community of Lut   Lot     committed grave sins  
Allah is the Transcendent of all   the Protector and Far   Superior to all  
Or any other created matter which you deem even harder   than these things and which is not susceptible to becoming a living thing     Then   in this condition   they will say   Who will bring us back to life   Say   He Who created you the first time   They will then shake their heads at you   by way of wonder and ridicule   and will say   When will it happen   Say   It is expecte
And nor were you   present at that time   on the side of Tur when We called out Musa   Moses     But   enlightening you on all these matters of the Unseen   is an   exceptional   Mercy from your Lord so that   having awareness of these incidents   you may warn these people   of the torment of Allah   to whom no Warner has come before you   in order that they may accept admonition

Say   Give your view   Allah sent down for you   pure and clean   provision   but you declared some of those   things   unlawful and   others   lawful   Say   Did Allah accord you   its   permission   Or are you fabricating a lie against Allah  
Ha   Mim     Only Allah and the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   know the real meaning

You can never attain to piety unless you spend   in the cause of Allah   out of that which you like the most   and Allah surely knows well whatever you give away  
Whip a hundred lashes each   the   unmarried   adulteress and the adulterer   on validation of adultery in accordance with conditions of statutory   hadd   punishment   If married   then both are to be stoned to death     And you should not feel even the slightest pity for both of them   in executing the command of Din   Religion     if you have faith in Allah and the Last Day   A
Neither do they have power to help these   polytheists   nor can they help even themselves  
And those who disbelieved   for them is the Fire of Hell   Neither will   death   be decreed for them that they should die   nor will anything of their torment be lessened   We pay back every disobedient the same way

And Allah explains similitudes for   the Guidance of   people and Allah is Well Aware of everything  
And will   be seated   in special nearness to the Sovereign Lord of   true   Power during holy sessions  
Do you worship   the idol named   Bal and turn away from the Best of creators  
And of course the Messengers were mocked before you too   Then those who ridiculed were beset by the same   torment   which they used to make fun of  
Such is the punishment   And truly the torment of the Hereafter is far greater   than this     Would that they only knew  
Call them   the adopted sons   after their fathers   names     That is most just in the sight of Allah   So if you do not know their fathers   then they are your brothers   in Din   Religion     and your friends   And there is no sin on you for what you said by mistake but   that will be a sure sin   which your hearts intend   And Allah is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
O Believers   If you obey the disbelievers   they will turn you back on your heels   to disbelief     You will then turn back as losers  
Muhammad   blessings and peace be upon him   is the Messenger of Allah   And those with him are hard and tough against the disbelievers but kind   hearted and merciful among themselves   You see them excessively bowing and prostrating themselves   They simply seek Allahs grace and pleasure   Their mark is an impression of prostrations on their faces   prominent on the foreheads as

  All   those   favours   which they will long for   are in store   for them with their Lord   This is the reward of those who are committed to   piousness and   spiritual excellence  
While the disbelievers anchored in their hearts the conceited obstinacy   which was   stubbornness and egocentricity of the days of ignorance   Allah sent down on His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and the believers an exceptional calmness and tranquillity and made them firm on the Word of Godwariness   And it is this that they were most entitled to and   also   wor
Then again woe to you   on the Last Day     then woe to you   in Hell    
Who fulfil their pledge to Allah and do not breach their covenant  
And when solely Allah is mentioned   the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter constrict and recoil with disgust   and when the idols   that they worship   are mentioned apart from Allah   they rejoice all of a sudden  
And of His Signs is also that you   first   see the earth dry   and worthless     but when We rain water on it   it becomes green and fresh and brings forth vegetation   Surely He Who has brought this   dead earth   to life again certainly He is the One Who will give life to the dead   on the Day of Resurrection     Surely He has Absolute Power over everything  
They will say   Did your Messengers not come to you with clear Signs   They will reply   Yes   of course     Then the keepers   will say   So pray yourselves   But the disbelievers prayer will   always   be in vain  
When the caravan left   Egypt     his father   Yaqub   Jacob     said   while sitting in Canaan     If you do not consider me unstable due to senility   I am smelling the fragrance of Yusuf   Joseph    
And had they believed in Allah and the   Last   Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and the   Book   that has been revealed to him   they would not have made friends with those   enemies of Islam     But most of them are disobedient  
These are the limits set by Allah   And the one who obeys Allah and His Messenger   blessing and peace be upon him     He   Allah   will admit him to the Gardens beneath which rivers flow   They shall reside therein forever   and this is a great achievement  
And   He   also distinguishes the identity of those who are hypocrites   And when it was said to them   Come and fight in the cause of Allah or defend   against the enemy invasion     they said   If we knew that there would be a war   actually of some kind or had we considered it a war in the cause of Allah   we would certainly follow you   That day they were closer to an evident

So     O Muslims     when you have finished your Prayers   remember Allah   in all postures     standing   sitting and   lying down   on your sides   And when   free of fear   you feel secure   establish Prayers   as prescribed     Verily   Prayer is obligatory for Muslims in accordance with the fixed timings  
Blessed is He   Allah   Who sent down to His   most beloved and most intimate   servant the Criterion   the Quran   that   draws the difference between right and wrong and   gives judgment in order that he may be a Warner to all the worlds  
  O listener     Have you not seen that Allah has created the heavens and the earth in accordance with   a strategy based on   the Truth   He can annihilate you if He so wills and bring new creation   in your place    
Say   The knowledge   of that Hour   is with Allah alone and I am just a clear Warner     If the time is disclosed there will be no fear any more    
  O Allah     You alone do we worship and to You alone we look for help  
We know best the motive with which they listen to with active attention when they give you ears   and when they whisper and when these wrongdoers say   to the Muslims     You are following only a person that is bewitched   i   e   a spell has been cast on him   And We see and hear all this    
Thus Allah makes His Commandments clear to you so that you may understand  
By the passing time   whose rotation bears witness to the affairs of mankind    
So man should look at his food   and ponder    
And shake the trunk of date   palm towards you   It will shed fresh ripe dates upon you  
He is the One Who is the Originator of the heavens and the earth   How can He have children when He has no wife   And He is the One Who has created everything and He has the best knowledge of everything  
And those who embrace faith and do pious works persistently and believe in this   Book   which has been revealed to Muhammad   blessings and peace be upon him   and that is the very Truth from their Lord   Allah erases their evil works from their   record of deeds   and refines their states of being  
He will be in luxury and delight  
Indeed the number of months with Allah has been   inscribed as   twelve in the Book of Allah   i   e   permanent Law of Nature   since the Day He created the   system of   the heavens and the earth   Of these four months   Rajab   Dhul   Qada   Dhul   Hijja and Muharram   are sacred   This is the right Din   Religion     So do not wrong your souls during these months   by initiati
So always eat of that   slaughtered animal   over which the Name of Allah has been pronounced   at the time of slaughter   if you believe in His Revelations  
Nor do we have any passionate friend  
He is the One Who created you   Then   someone   of you became a disbeliever and   the other one   of you became a believer and Allah sees best the actions that you do  
Then what will those resources which they were utilizing do   to drive that torment away from them    
Will be the food of the major sinners  
So on that Day the excuse of the wrongdoers will not be of any benefit to them   nor will they be asked to please   Allah

When His Lord called out to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa  
Then when He gives them a healthy child   both of them associate partners with Him in respect of that   child     But Allah is Transcendent of all that they ascribe to Him as partners  
Listen   You are the people who have also been disputing about matters of which you had   but some   knowledge   But why do you dispute about things of which you have no knowledge   at all     And Allah knows but you do not know  
That put him   Musa   Moses     into a box and place that   box   in the river   Then the river will drift it to the bank   My enemy and his enemy will pick him up   And I cast on you from My Presence a reflection of My   Exceptional   love   i   e   We have made you so lovely and charismatic that whoever glance at you will be fascinated     And   this was done   so that you might

Allah   alone   is   God     There is no God but He   And the believers should put their trust in Allah alone  
And there are some among the people who take others besides Allah as His partners and love them as it is Allahs due alone   But those who believe love Allah the most   far more intensely than anyone else     And if these wrongdoers happen to see that time when the torment   of the Last Day   will be before their eyes   then they will become aware   that the Master of all the force
I do not worship those   idols   that you worship  
The inmates of Hell and the people of Paradise cannot be equal   It is the people of Paradise who are successful and victorious  
  O disbelievers     If you sought a decisive victory then the victory   of the Truth   has certainly reached you   It will be best for you if you desist   even now     But if you opt for the same   mischief   We shall   also   afflict you with the same   punishment   and your army   may it be of any large size   will not be of any avail to you   And Allah is surely on the side of

Then by the   angels   who manage different affairs well  
Divorce is   revocable   two times   only     Then either retain   the wife   with honour   in marital relationship   or release her with kindness   And it is not lawful for you to take back anything of that which you have given them   unless both fear that   now by maintaining marital ties   they may not be able to observe the limits set by Allah  
Then their skins and hearts get softened and they get   lost   into the Remembrance of Allah   in a weeping mood    
And they will not remember   it   unless Allah so wills   He is the One to Whom fearing   and righteousness   is due   and He alone is the Lord of Forgiveness  
And those of you who die and leave   their   widows behind must leave a will for their widows   before they die   to provide them for their maintenance for one year   and   not to turn them out of their houses  
The Bedouins say   We have believed   Say   You have not believed   Yes   rather say   We have accepted Islam   And the belief has not yet gone into your hearts   If you obey Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     He will not decrease anything   in reward   for your deeds   Surely Allah is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
There is no sin on you if you enter   without permission   those houses   or buildings   which are not any permanent residences   such as hotels   roadhouses and inns     You have the right to get benefit therein   And Allah knows   all   that you disclose and that you conceal  
  Also   tell   them     I do not have any control over profit and loss for myself   except   that much   which Allah wills   And   in the same way   if I had the knowledge of the Unseen on my own   without Allahs bestowal     I would myself have managed abundant good fortune   and victories     and no hardship   and trouble on any occasion   would have touched me     By virtue of
So what about him whose evil action has been made attractive to him but he starts considering it good   actually   Can he be like a virtuous believer     Surely Allah holds astray whoever He wills and guides to the straight path whoever He wills     O life of the universe     Let not your soul waste away in grief for them   Surely Allah is Best Aware of whatever they do  
Many of the People of the Book desire to turn you back to disbelief after you have believed because of the jealousy they have in their hearts   despite the fact that the Truth has become evident to them   So keep forbearing and overlooking till Allah sends His Command   Verily Allah has   Absolute   Control over everything  
It is they who have denied the Signs of their Lord and meeting Him   after death     So all their deeds are ruined   and We shall not give any weight or   even   any worth to them on the Day of Rising  
And this is   also   with the intention that Allah may bring   more   refinement to the believers   i   e   cleanse and purify them   and annihilate the disbelievers  
We then grow from it grain  
Which are exalted   and   purified  
By the growing morning bright   when the sun gains height and spreads its radiance    
And had it not been settled already by your Lord and the time   of the Day of Resurrection   not fixed   for their torment   befalling them   the calamity   right now   would have been inevitable  
Well   is there anyone that can muster an army to help you against the Most Kind Lord   The disbelievers are merely   snared   in deception  
So never think that Allah will ever break His promise with His Messengers   Indeed Allah is Almighty   the Lord of Retribution  
And   call to mind the account of   Ayyub   Job   when he called out to his Lord   Misery has laid a hand on me   and You are the Most Merciful of all the merciful  
The disbelievers say   Shall we be reverted to the former life  
Has the news of the troops reached you  
Allah has explained an example   that   there is a slave   possessed by   some master     having no control over anything   himself     and   the other   is the one We have given the best provision   so he gives out to others out of it secretly and openly   can the two be held equal   All praise belongs to Allah alone   But most of them do not know   even the basic reality    
So when she   Zulaikha   heard their deceitful talk   she sent for them and arranged a meeting for them     She placed fruit before them   and gave each one of them a knife and requested   Yusuf     Walk out before them   so that they may realize the cause of my state of mind     So   when they glanced at Yusuf   Joseph and   saw   his dazzling beauty     they began to exalt   the
  Yusuf   Joseph   refused   but she   Zulaikha   had definitely made up her mind for him   And he too   might   have resolved had he not seen the Clear Sign of his Lord   It was   made to happen   like that   in order that   We keep away from him affliction and indecency both   Assuredly he was of Our chosen   exalted   servants  
Until when We open to them the gate of an extremely harsh torment     then     at that time   taken aback   they will   stay   therein stunned in despair  
Many faces on that Day will be humiliated and degraded  
Remember   You are those who are called to spend in the Way of Allah   Then there are some of you who act miserly   And whoever acts miserly   does it only against himself   And Allah is Independent and you   all   are dependent   And if you turn away from the Command of Allah   He will replace you with another people who will not be like you  
Except someone who repents and believes and persists in righteous works   they will enter Paradise and will not be wronged in the least  
And he will talk to the people   alike   both in the cradle and in ripe years   and he will be one of the pious servants   of Allah    
And   O my people   give full measure and full weight with justice   and do not give people their things less than their due   And do not spread destruction in the land by becoming mischief   mongers  
There   in Paradise   they will not taste death except the first death   which would have passed     And Allah will save them from the torment of Hell  
O Prophet   Surely We have made lawful for you those of your wives whom you have paid their dower and those who are in your possession   according to Allahs Commandments   whom Allah has given you as spoils of war   and the daughters of your paternal uncles   and the daughters of your paternal aunts   and the daughters of your maternal uncles   and the daughters of your maternal a
Then he will be entertained with scalding boiling water  
Then they will be left with no other excuse except that they   will   say   By Allah   our Lord   we did not associate partners with Allah  
So keep giving to the close relative his due and to the needy and the wayfarers   their due     That is best for those who seek the pleasure of Allah and it is they who will achieve the goal  
And halt them   near the Passage     they will be interrogated  
Soon shall We plant   your   awe into the hearts of disbelievers because they have associated that partner with Allah for which He has not sent down any authority   And Hell is their abode and extremely horrible is   that   abode of the wrongdoers  
A large group of them will be from the earlier people  
And a believing man from among the people of Pharaoh who had kept his faith secret said   Do you kill a man   just   because he says   Allah is my Lord   And he has brought you clear Signs from your Lord  
Surely the Day of Judgment is the appointed time for all of them  
And   recall the time   when early morning you left your blessed abode   on the eve of the battle of Uhud   and were positioning the Muslims at their posts for the battle   And Allah is All   Hearing   All   Knowing  
Surely Ibrahim   Abraham   was an Umma     Community   in himself     exclusively obedient to Allah   turning away from all falsehood   ever inclined and given to Him alone   and was not of those who associate partners with Allah  
He is the One Who sent a   Glorious   Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   among the illiterate people from among themselves who recites to them His Revelations and cleanses and purifies them   outwardly and inwardly   and teaches them the Book and Wisdom   Indeed they were in open error before   his most welcome arrival    
And always fulfil the promise of Allah when you promise   and do not break oaths after making them firm while you have already made Allah a surety over you   Surely Allah knows well whatever you do  
So   have sexual relations with them now   during the nights of the fasts without any inhibition   and seek what Allah has prescribed for you  
  O Esteemed Beloved     Adopt forbearance   always command piousness   and keep aloof from the ignorant  
O Children of Yaqub   Jacob     Remember My favour that I bestowed upon you and   especially   the supremacy which I awarded you over all the communities   of that age    
Alas   If once we could have   a chance to   return   to the world     we would become believers  
And   remember   Zakariyya     Zacharias   as well   when he called out to his Lord   O my Lord   leave me not single and You are the Best of all inheritors  
  O Pharaoh     We shall today preserve your   lifeless   body so that you may become a Sign   of warning   for those who come after you   Indeed most of the people are neglectful   in understanding   Our Signs  
Guidance and mercy for the pious  
Well   is there anyone that can provide you sustenance if   Allah   holds back His sustenance   from you     In fact they are adamantly fixed in rebellion and hatred   for Truth  
Is it you who are harder to create or   the entire   galactic universe that He has built  
Then it will be said to   these   wrongdoers   Taste the everlasting punishment   You will not be recompensed   anything more   but for the same   deeds   that you used to earn  
Allah has given an example of such a   slave   person that is owned by many partners who are ill   mannered and mutually quarrelsome as well   And   on the other side   there is a person who is a slave only to one master   Can they both be alike     Not at all     All praise belongs to Allah alone   But most of them do not know   the Truth of the Oneness of Allah    
And those who accuse chaste women   of adultery     then fail to produce four witnesses   whip them eighty lashes   as qadhaf punishment for false accusation   and never accept their evidence   And it is they who are the evildoers  
Then Allah seized him in   dual   punishment of this world and the Hereafter  
To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth   i   e   He opens His treasures to whom He wills     He grants sustenance abundantly to whom He likes and sparingly   to whom He wills     Surely He knows everything best  
And those who dispute about   the Din   Religion   of   Allah after it has been accepted   their discussion and contention is false in the sight of their Lord   And upon them is the wrath   of Allah   and for them is severe torment  
  And also recall the time   when Isa son of Maryam   Jesus son of Mary   said   O Children of Israel   indeed I am   a Messenger   sent to you by Allah   confirming the Torah   the Book which came before me   and bearing the good news of   the pleasant arrival   of   the Esteemed   Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   who will come after me   whose name is Ahmad   now in
So that Allah may bring   this thing   to light that surely they   the Messengers   have communicated the Messages of their Lord and Allah has   already   encompassed what they have   of Allahs Injunctions and the knowledge of the Unseen   and He has kept count of everything  
So Musa   Moses   put his staff down   on the ground   and that at once became a serpent evidently clear  
And be not like those who forgot Allah   So Allah made them forget their own souls   that they could send forward some good for their own souls     It is they who are defiant  
Surely it is We Who give life and it is We Who cause death and to Us is the return  
  Observing these signs of Our Might   know that   the Day of Judgment   Resurrection too   is certainly a fixed time  
No calamity occurs in the earth or in your lives but it is in a Book   al   Lawh al   Mahfuz   the station of Allahs pre   eternal knowledge     before We make it happen   Surely this   all   encompassing and perfect knowledge   is very easy for Allah  
Entitled to obligatory obedience   by all the worlds because obedience to him is obedience to Allah   and faithful to His trust   possesses Revelation and all divine secrets of the heavens and the earth    
And when it is said to them   Fear that   torment   which is before you and which is behind you so that you may be shown Mercy  
He is merely a man who has put a false blame on Allah   and we are not going to believe in him at all  
And by the earth and by that   force which   by Allahs Command     pulled it   from the sun far   apart  
And   after his death   We shall inherit from him what he proclaims   and he will come to Us all alone   without wealth and children    
They said   Raise for him a building   to burn him     then cast him into the blazing fire   in it    
Indeed when water   of the Deluge   overflowed the limit   We carried you in the floating Ark  
And they said   We are super respecting wealth and children and we are not going to be tormented  
Say   Shall I take   for worship   anyone as   my   friend other than Allah   Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth   and He feeds   all   and is not fed   Himself     Say   I have been commanded to become the first Muslim   who bows his head before His Holy Presence   and   this too has been commanded     never to be one of the polytheists  
Are you worried about donating in charity before your submission to the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   in secret   So when you did not do   that   and Allah lifted from you probe   i   e   relaxed this restriction     then establish Prayer and pay Zakat   the Alms   due   and obey Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   persistently   And Allah i
Surely those   idols   whom you worship besides Allah are also slaves   of Allah   just like you   So when you call on them   they should answer you if you are true   in making them gods    
Have they not seen that Allah releases sustenance in abundance for whom He wills and restrains it   for whom He likes     Surely there are Signs in it for those who believe  
O Believers   The polytheists are an embodiment of impurity   So let them not come closer to the Sacred Mosque after this year of theirs   i   e   after victory over Makka in   A   H       If you fear poverty   due to decline in your trade   then   do not worry     Allah will soon enrich you from His Bounty if He so wills   Surely   Allah is All   Knowing   Most Wise  
  These are the people   who remain steadfast and always trust their Lord alone  
And   do they not see   how have the mountains been created   raised out of the earth    
Certainly ruined are they who kill their children without   true   knowledge out of   sheer   foolishness   and make those   things   unlawful which Allah has bestowed upon them   as sustenance     inventing a lie against Allah   They have certainly lost the straight path and could not be rightly guided  
And how many a community have We destroyed before them   Do you perceive even a trace or hear even the faintest fizzle of anyone of them  
And We delivered those who believed and always put to work piety   and self   protecton    
And refrain from having sexual contact with your wives while you are in retreat in the mosques  
They will not believe in it until they see the painful torment  
And We have set a wall before them and a wall behind them   and We have cast a veil over their eyes so they do not see anything  
He is the One Who has revealed to you the Book comprising some firm and solid Verses   i   e   literally clear and precise in meaning     they are the foundation of   commandments   of the Book   And other Verses are figurative   i   e   containing abstract and allusive meaning     So   those who have deviation in their hearts follow only its figurative Verses   just   under the u
So     O Esteemed Beloved     continue to admonish   them     By the grace and blessing of your Lord you are neither a soothsayer   i   e   the one who gives news through the jinn   nor a madman  
But when they spurred Our wrath   by denigrating the dignity of Musa   Moses       We took revenge on them and drowned them all  
And   besides   they held the view that   killing or belying the Messengers   would not result into any torment   So they became blind and deaf   Allah   then   accepted their repentance   But most of them   again   turned blind and deaf   i   e   incapable of perceiving the truth by seeing and hearing     And Allah is Ever Watchful of what they are doing  
Say   Do you worship besides Allah someone that has no power to do you any harm or good   Allah is the One Who is All   Hearing   All   Knowing  
The time of reckoning of people has drawn near but   rapt in heedlessness   they are disinclined   to obedience    
Nor will they be allowed to offer any excuses  
Or   lest   you start saying   It was but our ancestors who associated partners with Allah before and we were but   their   descendants after them   i   e   they are the real sinners   not we     So   will You destroy us on account of that   sin   which the infidels perpetrated  
And had Allah so willed   the people succeeding these Messengers would never have disputed and fought among themselves   after the manifest Signs had come to them   But they differed   owing to the free will which was endowed to them to be answerable before Allah for their performance     So   some of them believed while others opted to disbelieve  
And how will you disbelieve   now   while you are   fortunate   ones to whom the Verses of Allah are recited   and the Messenger of Allah   blessings and peace be upon him   is   himself   present among you   And whoever holds fast to   the Embrace of   Allah is most surely guided to the straight path  
Who is he that will lend to Allah a generous loan   He will   then   multiply it for him manifold   And Allah it is Who decreases and increases   your sustenance   and towards Him will you be returned  
He has not begotten any nor is He begotten  
How shall Allah guide those who disbelieved after embracing faith while they had borne witness that this Messenger is true   and clear Signs too had come to them   And Allah does not guide the wrongdoers  
Truly your Lord opens up sustenance for whom He pleases and folds up   for whom He wills     Verily   He is All   Knowing of His servants   works and affairs     All   Seeing  
O Believers   When you encounter any   enemy   army   stand firm and remember Allah abundantly so that you may attain to success  
Verily those who falsely accuse chaste believing women who are unaware of and unacquainted   with even the very idea of indecency and evil   are cursed in this world and in the Hereafter   And for them is woeful punishment  
And they had intended an evil plot against Ibrahim   Abraham   but We failed them badly  
And created the jinn from a flame of fire  
Do you feel free of this fear that He may sink you   into the land   right at the shore or may send to you stone storm   Then you will not find any helper for yourselves  
Nor did we feed the poor  
They it is   the people of Paradise   who will live in it forever   This is the reward of the deeds they used to do  
  Now admonished all mankind     Then he who turns away after this   affirmation     it is they who will be the disobedient  
And they wondered that a Warner had come to them from among themselves and the disbelievers said   He is a magician   a great liar  
Have they not looked into the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever Allah has created   apart from that   And have they not considered that   it may well be that their appointed term   death   has drawn near   Then what will they believe in after this  
They both did not teach anything to anyone   so much so that they would say   We are merely   for   trial   therefore   do not become disbelievers   by putting faith in it    
Indeed that   Hell   throws up sparks and flames   huge   as a lofty palace  
And all their evil works will be exposed which they used to do   and that   torment   will beset them which they used to make fun of  
Allah does not like anyones foul words being voiced loud   publicly and openly   except by one who has been a victim of oppression     he is allowed to expose the cruelty of the oppressor     and Allah is All   Hearing   All   Knowing  
There is no guide for one whom Allah holds astray   And He leaves them to wander in defiance so that they may grope on  
But those with   glittering   white faces will be in Allahs Mercy   Therein will they live forever  
And had there not been Allahs Grace and His Mercy upon you   for the sake of the Holy Prophet   you too would have been destroyed like the former communities     But Allah is Most Clement   Ever   Merciful  
And if they see a fragment of the sky falling   on them   even then   they will say   It is a layered   thick   cloud  
Have We not broadened your breast for you   for the light of knowledge   wisdom and spiritual gnosis    
Indeed those who persecute the believing men and women and then do not   even   repent   for them is the punishment of Hell   and for them is   especially   the torment of burning in the Fire  
Ah   Woe to   these   servants   Never did a Messenger come to them but they used to mock him  
Say   Yes     of course     and you will be disgraced and humiliated   as well    
Indeed the Messengers were mocked   by the disbelievers   before you   as well     So I granted the disbelievers respite and then seized them   with torment       See   then how My torment was  
Assuredly upon Us rests its collection and preservation   in your breast   and its recitation   by your tongue    
  It implies   the Day of Resurrection when   the whole of   mankind will become like scattered moths  
So see how was the end of those who were warned  
And Musa   Moses   said   O my people   if you have believed in Allah   then put your trust in Him alone if you are   truly   the believers  
And when their eyes will be turned towards the inmates of Hell   they will say   O our Lord     join   us not   together   with the unjust people  
To awake drive among the Quraish  
And     besides this favour in the Hereafter   He will grant you   another   worldly blessing too   which you earnestly desire     that is   help from Allah and a near victory   and     O Esteemed Prophet     give this good news to the believers     This came about in the form of Makkan Victory and the conquests in Persia and Rome    
Assuredly Allah loves those who fight in the way of Allah   so   organized in ranks as if they were a wall cemented with molten lead   to eliminate injustice   tyranny and terrorism and restore peace and human dignity    
Leave early for your tilth if you want to pick the fruit  
And that we thought that man and jinn would never tell a lie against Allah  
In an elevated lofty Paradise  
  And it will be said to them     This is what you were promised     it is meant   for everyone who turns to Allah in repentance and who guards   his Din   Religion   and Faith    
That Day man will retrospect his   every   effort and action  
As an example they were an extremely bad community who belied Our Revelations     In fact   they persistently wronged their own souls  
Many faces will be fresh and in full bloom that Day  
Enter it in peace   this is the Day of Eternity  
Until when Our Command   of torment   came and the oven started gushing   like fountains   then   We said     O Nuh   Noah       get aboard the Ark a pair of animals   male and female   of every species and   take in   your family also except those against whom the Command   of destruction   has already gone forth   and whoever has believed   take him also with you     And   excep
Say   Obey Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     but if you turn away   from obedience   then   beware that   the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   is simply responsible for the duty he is charged with and you are responsible for what you are charged with   And if you obey him you will be guided   And nothing is   obligatory   for the Messenger 
It is they against whom the Command of Allahs   torment   has proved true among generations that have passed of the jinn as well as mankind   Surely they   all   were the losers  
Surely this is a Glorious Quran   which is being sent down on the most Glorious Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him      
So they should worship the Lord of this   Sacred   House   Kaba   to give Him thanks    
When their   kinship   brother Hud said to them   Do you not fear   Allah    
Yes indeed   Would that you knew with the knowledge of certitude   the consequence of greed for wealth and riches and your negligence   Then   lost in the worldly pleasures   you would never forget the Hereafter like this    
They are the ones whose works have become void both in this world and in the Hereafter   And they shall have no helpers  
Indeed those who eat up the property of orphans unjustly fill their bellies but with fire   and soon will they fall into a Blazing Fire  
Say     The leave for   all intercession rests with Allah alone   which He has specified for His intimate servants     The Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth also belongs to Him alone   Then to Him you will be returned  
And   you   will drink boiling water over it  
Indeed those who disbelieved   by concealing the Truth     and left this world while they were disbelievers   upon them is the curse of Allah and of the angels and of all mankind  
And We preserved his virtuous remembrance   praise   among the succeeding generations  
Yet he desires that I should give him more  
And for your benefit He has subjected the sun and the moon   to a regular system     they keep rotating   in their respective orbits     And He has also subdued the night and the day   to a system   for your   system of life    
So when both of them reached the junction of the two seas   they forgot their fish   there     So   that   fried fish came back to life and   made its way into the sea like a tunnel and slipped off  
And as for him who shall be given his record behind his back  
Verily   We have revealed to you the Book which contains   means and substance for   your admonition   So do you not have sense  
And relate to them his account   too   whom We gave Our Signs   but then he made an exit from their   knowledge and admonition   and Satan chased him   So he turned into one of those who lost the right path  
Or do they possess the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them     If so     then they should tie up ropes and climb up   to heaven    
Surely in this   incident   there is a great Sign   of Allahs Infinite Power     And most of them were not the believers  
Alif   Lam   Mim     Only Allah and the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   know the real meaning    
So   when Talut   Saul   and his companions in faith crossed the stream they said   We have no strength today to face Jalut   Goliath   and his forces  
And how many a town I gave respite while it was given to wrongdoing and then I seized it   with torment     And to Me has   everyone   to return  
Then the people came to him running   on returning from the festival    
Say   Whoever is an enemy to Jibril     Gabriel   he is doing injustice     because he is the one who has brought down upon your heart only by Allahs Command   the Quran which   confirms the preceding   Books   and contains   absolute   guidance and glad tidings for the believers  
And   call to mind   when your Lord brought forth the human race from the loins of the Children of Adam and made them bear testimony to their own souls   and said     Am I not your Lord   They   all   said   Why not   We bear witness   that You alone are our Lord   This He did   lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection   We were unaware of this promise  
And We have taken off the load   of grief of the Umma   Community     from you  
By the Quran   full of Wisdom  
And I do not know   on my own   that this   delaying of the torment and the respite given to you   may perhaps be a trial for you and the intention may be to provide   you   a benefit till a fixed time  
Everything in the heavens and in the earth glorifies Allah   His is the entire kingdom and His is all the praise   And He is All   Powerful over everything  
Nor do you worship   the Lord   Whom I worship  
But do not retain them to hurt so that you subject   them   to excesses  
They said     No indeed     in fact we have come to you with the   punishment   about which these people have had doubts  
And   at that time   the believers will say   Is it they who swore by Allah   by way of   solemn oaths that they were certainly with you   alone       But   all their deeds have gone void   So they have become the losers  
And put your hand into the opening of your collar   It will come out   turned   radiant white without any ill     Both these are   of the nine Signs   of Allah     Go   with them   to Pharaoh and his people   Surely they are disobedient people  
The Lord of Musa   Moses   and Harun   Aaron    
Allah is   His Self   Name   besides Whom there is no God   i   e   believe in Him alone and deny all other false gods     There are   also   many other Beautiful Names for Him   that speak of His most beautiful and fascinating attributes    
As if they   chaste maidens   were rubies and pearls  
So give the disbelievers a respite   for a while and not much but   let them relax a little   more    
And   recall the time   that Day when every person will appear pleading for himself   in his defence     and every soul will be given full recompense for whatever it will have done   and they will not be wronged in the least  
And   always   keep your   visible and spiritual   attire purified and cleansed   as before    
Then   if he is a truthful Messenger   why are the bracelets of gold not sent upon him or why do the angels not come with him in ranks   in succession    
So do not make haste against them   for torment     We Ourselves keep counting days   for their catastrophe    
  And also call to mind the incident   when Musa   Moses   said to his   young companion and   servant   Yusha ibn Nun   Joshua   the son of Nun     I will not step   back   until I arrive at the junction of the two seas or I travel on infinitely  
Surely those who believe and do pious works   Allah will admit them to Gardens with streams flowing under them   and those who disbelieve and are enjoying   worldly   gains and eat as cattle   animals   do   so Hell alone will be their abode  
Indeed Allah is your Lord   Who created the heavens and the earth in six aeons   six phases     and then   matching His Glory   ascended to His Throne   i   e   enforced in the universe the system of His Sovereign Command and Control     He wraps up the day with the night   under the arrangement that the day and the night   keep chasing one another swiftly   And the sun and the mo
And they will say   Woe to us   This is the Day of Requital  
And if you ask them   Who has created them   they will certainly say   Allah   Then where are they wandering disorientated  
And never did We send a Warner to any town but its wealthy ones would   always   say   We deny   the guidance   you have been sent with  
And there is a   guarantee of   life for you in retribution   i   e   vengeance of murder     O wise people   so that you may guard   against bloodshed and destruction    
  O Messenger     Follow the same that is revealed to you   and be steadfast until Allah gives His Judgment   and He is the Best of the judges  
This   act   would be the best   repentance   for you in the sight of your Creator  
And when they   the arrogant people   saw these   the indigent believers     they used to say   They have gone astray     i   e   they have lost the world while the Hereafter is nothing but fiction    
If   all   the trees on earth were pens and the ocean reinforced by seven more oceans was ink   even then the Words of Allah would never be exhausted   Surely Allah is Almighty   Most Wise  
They and their wives will be reclining on raised couches under the deep calming shades  
And if We had made the Messenger an angel   even then We would have made him   the form of   a man   and   even in that case     We would have put them in the same doubt which they are   already   in   i   e   confused over his physical appearance   they would say   He is a human being like us      
We extend help to all   those   ambitious of this world   as well as those   aspiring to the Hereafter   O Glorious Beloved   all this   is of your Lords Bestowal   And the Bestowal of your Lord is not forbidden   to   and restricted   to anyone    
And   they are so cowardly that   they swear by Allah that they are of you while they are not of you   But they are those who fear   the disclosure and outcome of their hypocrisy   So they appear to be Muslims as make   believe    
O Believers   Fear Allah and write off whatever balance remains of usury if you are believers   true to the core of your hearts    
And We do not send Messengers but as Bearers of glad tidings   to the people   and as Warners   And the disbelievers dispute with   these Messengers   taking leverage of false arguments so as to eliminate the Truth with   falsehood     And they scoff at My Revelations and the   torment   of which they are warned  
And there is nothing hidden in the heavens and the earth but is recorded in a Clear Book   al   Lawh al   Mahfuz    
All praise belongs to Allah alone Who is the Creator of   all the infinities of   the heavens and the earth   and Who makes the angels messengers having two or three or four wings   and adds to   and expands   the Creation as He wills   Surely Allah is All   Powerful over everything  
And He is the One Who   raised up   the overturned towns   of the people of Lut   Lot     and smashed them down  
Allah made that   gale   seize them for consecutive seven nights and eight days   So   you could see them lying dead   during that time as if   they were hollow roots of the uprooted palm trees  
And     O Most Esteemed Beloved     they ask you about Dhul   Qarnain   Say   I recite to you an account of him now  
Whoever brings one good deed will have to his credit   as a reward   ten more like it   and whoever brings an evil deed will not be punished for more than one similar   evil deed     And no injustice will be done to them  
He knows   best   what is before them and what is behind them   And to Allah are returned all matters  
Those who do not pay Zakat   the Alms   due     and it is they who deny the Hereafter as well

And whether you speak in secret or aloud   certainly He knows best   even   the things   hidden   in the hearts  
No doubt Iblis translated his idea about them into reality   So they followed him except a group comprising   the true   believers  
nd indeed there are others of them that fall due to fear of Allah  
He said to his father   who was in fact his uncle and he used to call him father for he had brought him up   and his people   What is it that you worship  
Musa   Moses   said   You throw   first     So when they threw   their strings and sticks on the ground   they bewitched the eyes of the people   and struck them with awe   and brought   forth   an extremely effective magic  
Before you many codes   of Divine Law   have passed   for the preceding nations     So travel in the earth and observe what was the end of those who belied  
And We enjoined upon man emphatically   to do good   in relation to his parents whose mother bore him   in her reproductive system   in pain after pain   and whose weaning also takes two years   and commanded him     Give thanks to Me and to your parents     You   have to return to Me alone  
And indeed We are the Master of the Hereafter and the world  
Saturday   the Sabbath   was ordained only for those who differed about it   and indeed your Lord will judge among them on the Day of Resurrection   in the matters   in which they used to differ  
And by the ten   blessed   nights  
The heavens may just burst at this   fabricated lie   and the earth split asunder and the mountains fall down to pieces  
And We made his virtuous remembrance endure among the successors   i   e   the Messengers and their people    
And when they came to Yusuf   Joseph     he offered his brother   Benjamin   a seat close to him   and   said   to him quietly     Verily I am your brother   Yusuf   Joseph     so feel not aggrieved at what they have been doing  
O Believers   Do not take your fathers   and forefathers   and brothers for friends if they love disbelief more than belief   And whoever of you befriends them   it is they who are the wrongdoers  
Your Lord will doubtlessly pay them in full for their works   He is certainly Well Aware of whatever they are doing  
What is the matter with you   How do you judge  
If you do not move out   to fight for the promotion of peace and human dignity     He will afflict you with grievous torment and will replace you with another people and you will not be able to do Him any harm   And Allah has Mighty Power over everything  
O People of the Book   Why are you denying Allahs Revelations while you bear witness yourselves   i   e   you have read everything in your Books    
He knows the treacherous eyes and also those secrets which the breasts hide   inside them    
And verily your Lord alone is Almighty   Ever   Merciful  
So which of your Lords blessings will you both deny  
And   likewise   when there came to them from Allah the Messenger     Muhammad   blessing and peace be upon him     who   originally   confirms that Book which they   already   possessed   a party of these People of the Book threw the   same   Book of Allah   the Torah   behind their backs as if they did not know
And whatever is in the heavens and the earth   all   belongs to Him alone   and obligatory   for all   is obedience to Him alone   Do you then fear   anyone   other than Allah  
And what is the matter with us that we should not believe in Allah and the Truth   i   e   Muhammad   blessings and peace be upon him   and the Holy Quran   which has come to us   while we   too   cherish   this   strong ambition that our Lord admit us   to His Mercy and Paradise   along with the most pious  
  It   is a fire kindled by Allah  
And We have not sent you but as a Bearer of good news   for the obedient servants of Allah   and as a Warner   to the rebels    
  This Command is being communicated to Umma   Community   through the Messenger     Nor worship those   idols   besides Allah which can neither profit nor harm you   Then if you do it   you will surely be among the wrongdoers the same moment  
You are but a Warner to him who fears it  
He Who is absolute beauty   Then He   the Effulgence of Beauty   decided to unveil   Himself    
When he said to his father   i   e   his uncle Azar who brought him up after his father Tarukh died     O my father   why do you worship these   idols   which cannot hear or see   nor can they remove any   troublesome   thing from you  
He is the One Who drew water from the earth   separately     and brought forth its vegetable kingdom   from the rest of the dry regions    
  Allah   said   The prayer of you both has indeed been granted   So remain steadfast both of you and follow not the path of those who do not possess knowledge  
With Him   under His control and possession   are the keys of the unseen   i   e   the ways and means by which the unseen is disclosed to someone     no one   by ones own effort   knows them but He   And He knows   directly   whatever is in the land and in the sea   And not a leaf falls but He knows it   There is not a grain in the folds of the earths darkness   nor anything green
Ta   Ha     Only Allah and the Messenger know the real meaning    
And the mountains will be like multicoloured carded wool  
Who establish Prayer and pay Zakat   the Alms   due   and those who believe in the Hereafter  
And indeed Ilyas   Elias too   was one of the Messengers  
And the disbelievers say   The Last Hour will not come upon us   Say   Why not   By my Lord Who is the Knower of the Unseen that is bound to come upon you   Nothing can be out of His sight   not even a dust particle in the heavens or in the earth   Nor is there anything smaller or bigger than an atom but is   recorded   in the light   giving Book   i   e   al   Lawh al   Mahfuz   
Beseech   I seek refuge with the Lord Who brought   the universe   into existence with   an   explosion extremely fast  
And surely We sent to the people of Thamud their   kinship   brother Salih   as a Messenger     Worship Allah   Then they became two parties disputing with each other  
And surely you have learnt   the reality of   the first creation   Then why do you not accept advice  
Allah does not forbid you to be good to them and treat them with equity and justice who did not fight against you on   the question of   Din   Religion     nor did they drive you out of your homes   i   e   homeland     Surely Allah likes those who conduct themselves with equity and justice  
And what is the matter with you that you do not believe in Allah while the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   is giving you the call to believe in your Lord   And surely Allah has already taken a firm covenant from you if you are the believers  
Whoever brings good   for him is reward better than that and whoever brings evil   then there is no compensation for the evildoers but equal to what they used to do  
  O Esteemed Beloved     We have certainly sent you with the Truth as a Bearer of good news and as a Warner   And you will not be asked about the inmates of Hell  
And the Jews said   Uzayr   Ezra   is the son of Allah   and the Christians said   The Messiah is the son of Allah   These are their   absurd   utterances that they voice with their mouths   They   acquire   resemblance with the saying of those who have disbelieved before   them     May Allah ruin them   Where are they wandering distracted  
  O Beloved     We have been watching your radiant face turning frequently towards heaven   So We will indeed make you turn towards that Qibla   direction of Prayer   which you feel pleased with   So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque right now   And     O Muslims     wherever you are   turn your faces towards it  
Except for the chosen and exalted servants of Allah  
And   also warn   that   It is My torment which is the most grievous torment  
If you both turn to Allah in repentance   that is better for you   because the hearts of both of you have inclined   towards the same   but if you help one another in this matter   that may annoy the Holy Prophet     So surely Allah is the One Who is his Friend and Helper and Jibril   Gabriel   and the most pious believers and after them   all   angels too are   his   helpers  
The one who remembers the Name of his Lord and offers Prayers   regularly and abundantly    
Then it will be said to them   This is   the punishment of Hell   which you used to belie  
Do they not know that indeed He is Allah alone Who accepts repentance of His servants and takes charity donations   i   e   Zakat and alms with His own Mighty Hand   and that Allah is the One Who is Oft   Relenting   Ever   Merciful  
He plans and executes the Command and Control System from the heavens to the earth   Then His Command ascends   and will ascend to completion   towards Him in one Day which measures one thousand years according to   the number   that you count  
You can only warn him who follows the direction and guidance and fears the Most Kind Lord unseen   So give him the good news of forgiveness and a reward of great honour  
  Salih   said     That Sign   is this she   camel   A time for water is   appointed   for her and on an appointed day is your turn for water  
The people who accuse   of pretentiousness and compulsion   those of the believers who give alms happily and willingly in   their   charity works   and also   blame   those   destitute Muslims   who find nothing   more to give   except for their toil and hard work   and   also   mock their   sentiment for spending in the cause of Allah     Allah will punish them for their scoffing
Or He would drown those   vessels or ships   due to their   evil   deeds which they have earned but He forgives many   mistakes    
Surely if they overpower you   after becoming aware of you     they will surely stone you to death or force you   through oppression   to return to their faith   And   if it so happens   then you will not prosper at all  
And indeed We sent Nuh   Noah   and Ibrahim   Abraham   and We placed Prophethood and the Revealed Book among their children   So   some   of them are rightly guided and most of them are disobedient  
And Allah has illustrated an example of two   such   men of whom one is dumb   has no power over anything and is a burden on his master   wherever he   the master   sends him   he brings no good   Can he   the dumb   be the equal to the   other   one who   holds such an office that he   enjoins the people to do justice   and he himself also follows the straight path  
If He wills   He will destroy you and bring in a new creation  
And I do not say   this   to you   I have treasures of Allah   i   e   I am a very rich person     nor do I know of the unseen on my own   without Allahs Revelation     Nor do I say   I am an angel   not a man   My message is not based on charismatic claims     Nor do I say pertaining to those who are inferior in your eyes   Allah will not award them any good at all   that is Alla
That I will fill Hell with you and with all those who will follow your   denigrating mindset    
They said   Bring him before the people so that they may see   him    
Stripping off the skin of all the limbs and the scalp  
And   also expelled them   from treasures and refined dwellings  
And ordain for me virtuous remembrance and acceptance among the coming generations   too    
And only the digressers follow the poets  
Is not Allah the Greatest of all the sovereigns  
Do you believe in some parts of the Book and deny some others   So he who does so from amongst you   what can be his punishment but disgrace   and humiliation   in the worldly life
Say     O disbelievers     just ponder   if His   torment   comes upon you   all of a sudden   by night or by day   then what will you opt to do     What is it that the evildoers want in haste  
  If your concept is correct   then that division is serious injustice  
And that you keep worshipping Me alone   That is the straight path  
And do not eat up one anothers wealth among yourselves through injustice   nor take wealth to the authorities   as a bribe   so that   this way   you may   also   swallow a portion of others wealth unfairly   while you are aware   that this is a sin    
  They will be attending   carrying bowls   ewers and cups filled with   transparent   drink of   nearness   from the free   flowing springs  
But if you do not do so   then stand red   alert on the declaration of war from Allah and His Holy Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     And if you repent   then your principal amounts are   lawfully   yours   Do not wrong and be not wronged  
Their   acceptance   of guidance is not your responsibility   It is Allah Who awards guidance whom He wills   And whatever wealth you give away   as charity donation   goes to your own benefit   It is not appropriate for you to spend but for Allahs pleasure alone   And whatever you spend of your wealth     its reward   will be paid back to you in full and you shall not be treated 
Surely this is Our provision which is never to exhaust  
Surely those who say   Allah is our Lord   then hold fast   to it   have nothing to fear   nor shall they grieve  
And     O Prophet     people ask about your edict on matters concerning   orphan   women   Say   Allah ordains you in their case and the commandment   already   being communicated to you in the holy Book   also   pertains to those orphan women whom you deny   the rights   which have been prescribed for them   And   in order to take their assets into possession   you want to marry 
Then it will be rending   of all heavenly bodies   asunder with single extremely horrible explosion  
So We paid them back for their disbelief and ingratitude   And We award   such   punishment to none except the highly ungrateful  
And everyone will be given recompense in full for his doings and He Knows full well what they do  
This   Holy Prophet   blessings and peace be upon him     is also a Warner of the Warners of old  
This   Quran   is guidance   And those who disbelieved in the Revelations of Allah   for them is in store extremely grievous torment  
And We indeed sent Messengers before you as well among earlier generations  
So that   Allah   may ask the Truthful about their truth   And He has prepared an agonizing torment for the disbelievers  
They will live therein forever   Those   lofty palaces in Paradise   are the most excellent lodgings and   decent   abodes  
So which of your Lords blessings will you both deny  
To replace them with people better than them and We are not at all incapable   of doing it    
  Their state of mind is such that   could they find a place of refuge or a cave or a crevice in the earth   they would turn towards it running very fast   and would not stay with you even for a moment   but they are under compulsion right now so they show off their untrue loyalty    
So glorify your Lord with His praise and live among those who prostrate themselves before Him  
And   that is the reason   when   some of the true Christians   listen to this   Holy Quran   which has been revealed to the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     you see their eyes overflowing with tears     This overflowing of tears   springs from the Truth of which they have   gained   gnosis     Besides   they submit   O our Lord   We have believed   in the Truth whi
Allah is the One Who has sent down the best Word  
We can say nothing except that some of our gods have afflicted you with   mental   disorder   Hud said   Indeed I call Allah to witness   and you too bear witness that I have no concern with those whom you associate as partners with Allah  
What is the matter with you that you do not have faith in or the gnosis of Allahs Majesty  
And he has indeed seen   the Absolute Beauty of the Lord of the Throne   on the effulgent horizon   of the Realm of Divinity    
Those   hypocrites   who pry into your   victory and setback     then if you are granted victory by Allah   they say   Were we not with you   And if the disbelievers get a portion   of some apparent breakthrough     they say   to them     Did we not get the better of you and   in spite of that   did we not save you from   ruin at the hands of   Muslims   So   Allah will judge betw
And He   Allah   is the One Who has created you from a single soul and made his spouse from that   so that he might find comfort in her   Then when man covers her   she conceives and   bearing a light burden   moves around   Later   when she grows heavy   then both pray to their Lord   Allah   If You give us a healthy child   we shall certainly be among the thankful  
O Believers   When on Fridays the call is made for   Jumua   Prayer   hasten towards the remembrance of Allah   i   e   the Jumua sermon and Prayer   immediately and abandon purchase and sale   i   e   business     That is better for you if you have knowledge  
This is how We bestowed upon Yusuf   Joseph   the rule over the land   of Egypt so that   he could live therein wherever he desired   We honour with Our Mercy whom We will and waste not the reward of the pious  
  Their plight   resembles those who have tasted the evil consequences of their doings shortly before them   i   e   the idolaters of Makka in Badr and Banu Nadir   Banu Qainuqa and Banu Quraiza of the Jews   etc       And there is for them grievous punishment   in the Hereafter as well    
He Who has created seven   or numerous   heavenly spheres corresponding to one another   layer upon layer     You will not find any irregularity and disproportion in the system of the creation of the Most Kind   Lord     So have a   meditative and thoughtful   look around   do you find in this   Creation   any incongruity or disharmony   i   e   degeneration or falling apart    
And those who emigrated after they had been subjected to   different kinds of   torture and brutality   We will certainly provide them with a better abode in this   very   world   And the reward in the Hereafter is certainly greater   Would that they knew   this secret  
And We are not deferring it but for an appointed term   which has already been fixed    
And grapes and vegetables  
Indeed those who have disbelieved   by denying Allahs witness   and done injustice   by denying the Messengers glory     Allah will by no means forgive them   nor will show them any path   on the Day of Judgment    
  O Glorious Beloved     Say   This is my way   I invite towards Allah   I am   firm and committed to   my vision and insight   I and also he who complies with me   And Holy is Allah   and I am not of the polytheists  
Nor can   anyway be scoffed or blamed   those who presented themselves to your service   with the purpose   that you may arrange for them mounts   for fighting   because they did not posses any means of conveyance     So you said   I   also   do not find any   additional means   to mount you on   Then   with your permission   they returned in such a state that their eyes were stre
And when a section of them said   to those who were performing the duty of preaching Dawa     Why do you advise a people whom Allah is about to destroy or afflict with severe torment   they replied   In order to submit   our   excuse before your Lord   and   also   because they may become righteous and Godwary  
And     O Glorious Beloved     in whatever state you may be and whatever portion you may recite from the Quran   and     O Umma   Community   of Muhammad     blessings and peace be upon him     whatever work you do   We witness and watch over you   at the time   when you are engaged in it   And not even the smallest particle in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from   the knowl
Allah is He apart from Whom there is none worthy of worship   He shall certainly gather you on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt   And who is more truthful in word than Allah  
And   in this way   belies good   Din   Religion     of Truth and life after death    
Verily We sent Our Messengers with clear Signs and We sent down with them the Book and the Balance of Justice so that people may grow firm and stable in justice   And   of minerals   We brought forth iron in which is fierce force   for weapons and defence   and which has   multiple other   benefits for people   in industrial development     And   the purpose is   that Allah may br
They swear their most solemn oaths by Allah that if there comes to them some   manifest   Sign   they shall certainly believe in that   Say   to them     Signs are but with Allah alone   And     O Muslims     how would you know that when the Sign comes   still   they will not believe  
How can a person who is a believer be like him who is disobedient     Nay     they   both   cannot be equal  
So that we may rain on them stones of baked clay  
And there is none of you but will pass over Hell   This   promise   is absolutely with your Lord which will certainly be fulfilled  
  O listener     If you have even a little doubt about this   Book   which We have revealed to you   through Our Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him       then inquire   about its authenticity   of those who have been reading the Book   of Allah   before you   The Truth has no doubt come to you from your Lord   so be not at all of those who doubt  
  The disbelievers wonder how all that would be arranged in Paradise   So   do they not see how has the camel been created   in an unusual form

  It is   sent down from the Most Kind   Lord     Ever   Merciful  
And it is not the poetry of a poet   composed with literary expertise     You have but little faith  
So when the promised first time of the two came to pass We brought upon you those of Our servants who were great warriors   Then   in   your   search they penetrated up to your dwellings   And   this   promise was sure to be fulfilled  
This documentation by you is more just in the sight of Allah   and makes evidence more solid and nearer to keeping you from doubt   except that if transactions are hand   to   hand which you carry out among yourselves then there is no sin on you if you do not write it down  
Have they not seen that Allah Who has created the heavens and the earth does   also   have the power to create the like of these people   again     And He has fixed a term for them wherein there is no   chance of   doubt   The wrongdoers have even then refused to believe but   this   is ingratitude  
Verily He creates the first time and He is the One Who will bring to life the second time  
Do they not ponder over the Quran   Had this   Quran come   from anyone other than Allah   these people would have found in it many contradictions  
And no doubt the people of the valley of al   Hijr   the Rock   too denied the Messengers  
And   it was commanded     Press your hand in your armpit   It will come out radiant white without any disease     This   is another Sign  
Until he reached the boundary   of a locality in the direction   of the sunrise   There he perceived   the rising of   the sun   as if   it were rising on the people   living in that piece of land   for whom We had provided no cover   for protection   against the sun   i   e   they lived in the caves   without clothes and houses    
  But when they saw it cautiously   they cried   Oh no     We have been deprived indeed  
And the disbelievers say   Why has any Sign not been sent down to him   the Messenger   from his Lord   Say   Verily Allah     despite Signs     holds astray whom He wills and leads him towards Himself who turns to Him in repentance  
O People of the Book   Indeed Our   Last   Prophet has come to you   at the juncture   when   the chain of   Messengers succession is breaking off   and he expounds to you   Our Commands and Injunctions   with ample clarity     because   you may   by way of excuse   say   There has come to us no Bearer of good news or a Warner     Now this excuse of yours has also lost ground beca
It is they who are   in fact   the true believers   For them are   high   ranks with their Lord and forgiveness and an honourable provision  
  It will be said to them     Relish your punishment   It is this punishment which you seek to hasten  
Say   Who provides you sustenance from the heavens and the earth   Say   yourself     Allah   provides     And no doubt either we or you are guided aright or lost in open error  
And when the disbelievers see you   they just start mocking you   and say     Is this the one who talks about your gods   with rejection and denial     And yet it is they themselves who reject the mention of the Most Kind   Lord    
Assuredly the Godfearing will be in a place of calm and peace  
Who   Himself   taught the Quran to   the Arab Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him      
The example of the worldly life is like water which We sent down from the sky   Then owing to this there came forth from the earth thick growth of vegetation which both men and cattle feed on   until when the earth took its   full   bloom and beauty and became fully embellished   and its inhabitants thought that   now   they had full control over it   then   emergently   Our comma

Follow this   Quran   which has been revealed to you from your Lord   There is no God except Allah   and turn away from those who associate partners with Allah  
And   he who   accumulated wealth and then held it   from distribution    
With the same water He grows for you crops and olives and date   palms and grapes and all kinds of fruit   Indeed there are Signs in it for those who reflect and meditate  
Then the one who repents after   this   wrong and mends his ways   Allah surely turns towards him in Mercy   Allah is indeed Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
Say   Our Lord will assemble all of us   on the Day of Rising     then will judge among us with the Truth   And He is the Best Judge   All   Knowing

And save them from   the punishment of   sins   And the one You saved from   the punishment of   sins that Day   You have indeed shown him great Mercy   And that is great success indeed  
  And Satan also said     Tell me   is it he You have exalted over me     What is its reason after all     If you grant me respite till the Day of Resurrection   I shall root out his children except a few of them   by bringing them under my control    
And   grow   thick gardens

Allah is the One Who has created cattle for you so that you may ride some of them and some of them you eat  
Assuredly   the evildoers are in   the fold of   error and insanity   or Fire

  These   nomad villagers are unyielding disbelievers and incorrigible hypocrites   And   due to their stubbornness in disbelief and hypocrisy   they deserve to remain ignorant of those limits and commandments which Allah has sent down to His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     And Allah is All   Knowing   Most Wise  
  It is   they who believed in Our Revelations and were always obedient   to Us    
  Be not also   of those   Jews and Christians   who disintegrated their religion and became sects and subsectsevery sect rejoices over what is with them  
  We   once more   assert   Dissent and denial are   in no way   right     They will come to know soon  
At the farthest Lote   Tree Sidrat al   Muntaha  
And   would also have done   ornamentation of gold and jewels   over this silver work     But all that is the temporary and worthless possession of the life of this world   And   the beauty and ornamentation of   the Hereafter is with your Lord   which is   only for the pious  
Have you not seen that Allah makes the night pass into the day and makes the day pass into the night   And   He is the One Who   has made the sun and the moon subservient   each rotating for an appointed term and that Allah is Aware of   all   the deeds that you do  
Do you approach only males   to satisfy your sexual desire   from among the people of the world  
And that He is the One Who causes death and gives life  
And He is the One Who has produced trellised and untrellised gardens   i   e   plants climbing up with supports and those not climbing up   and   also created   date   palms   and vegetation with a wide variety of fruits and olive and pomegranates   that   resemble   in shape   but differ   in taste     When   these trees   bear fruit   eat of their fruits and   also   give away i
And there is for everyone a   fixed   direction   motive     he turns to the same   So   move forward to take the lead towards the pious acts   Wherever you are   Allah will unite you all together   Surely   Allah has Absolute Control over everything  
When some fruit will be given to them from these gardens to eat they will say   looking at its appearance    
Say   O Jews   if you think that   leaving all other people   you alone are the friends of Allah   i   e   Awliya     then long for death   because His Awliya will not fear in the grave and the Hereafter   if you are true   in your thinking    
Then Ibrahim   Abraham   began striking   and breaking   them with full force  
And if   in waiting for your Lords mercy   i   e   prosperity   which you look forward to   you seek to avoid these   deserving ones due to scarcity of means     then say to them kind words  
And We categorically conveyed to the Children of Israel in the Book   You shall make mischief twice in the land and employ a violent defiance   against obedience to Allah    
And by the day when it brightens up  
Surely the submissive men and the submissive women   and the believing men and the believing women   and the obedient men and the obedient women   and the truthful men and the truthful women   and the steadfast men and the steadfast women   and the humble men and the humble women   and the men who give alms and the women who give alms   and the men who fast and the women who fast 
So a whirl   of disaster   from your Lord went round   that garden during the night   while they were asleep  
So that it may warn the one who is alive and the word of judgment may be proved against the disbelievers  
So We delivered him and those who were   aboard   with him in the fully loaded Ark  
We have   indeed   warned you of the impending torment   On that Day   everyone will see whatever   acts   he has sent ahead and   every   disbeliever will say   Would that I were dust   and escaped this punishment    
Soon the Bedouins who lagged behind   from participating in al   Hudaibiya   will say to you   apologetically     Our money matters and families kept us busy     Therefore   we missed your company     So ask forgiveness for us from Allah   They utter such   words   with their tongues that are not in their hearts   Say   Who has the power to save you against   the decision   of All
Allah said   Go   respite is granted to you     So whoever of them follows you   Hell indeed is the only befitting punishment for you all  
The hypocrites   men and women   are one from another   alike     They command evil and forbid good and are close   fisted   in the matter of spending in the cause of Allah     They have forgotten Allah   so Allah has forgotten them   It is indeed the hypocrites who are disobedient  
And that is how your Lord grips   He seizes the communities when they   become   tyrannous and corrupt   Surely His grip is agonizing and fierce  
Have they any share in the Kingdom   If so   they would not give   anything   to the people worth even a speck   because of their niggardliness    
Does he promise you that   when you die and become dust and   decomposed   bones   then you will be brought forth   alive again    
  Also   say   to them     Tell me if the punishment of Allah comes upon you all of a sudden or openly   will   any other   be destroyed except those who do injustice  
And   forbidden to you are also   women having husbands except those   prisoners of war   who come into your legal possession   Allah has prescribed for you   these Commands of forbiddance     And   all women   other than these are made lawful for you   so that you may wish them for marriage by means of your money   dower     maintaining chastity and not in pursuit of satisfying l
So     O man     which of the favours of your Lord will you doubt  
Lut   Lot   said   Would that I had the power to resist you or I could seek shelter   today   in some indomitable fort  
But if they themselves walk out   on their own   then there is no sin on you for whatever they may do for themselves according to usage   And Allah is Almighty   Most Wise  
And the stars will fall   from their galaxies    
  Luqman said     O my son   if there is a thing equal to the grain of a mustard seed   hidden   inside a rock or in the heavens or in the earth     even then   Allah will bring it forth   for reckoning on the Day of Judgment     Surely Allah is the Subtle Knower of the minutest matters   All   Aware and Most Vigilant   as well    
And   in the world   they are directed to pure and decent talk and are guided to the favourite path   of Islam    
For your Lord will have made subservient to her   the symbolic language of   sharp signals  
  O people     It is to Him that you all are to return     that   is Allahs true promise   Surely He is the One Who originates the creation   Then He is the One Who will repeat it so that He rewards with justice those who believe and do righteous works   And those who reject faith and disbelieve   there is for them scalding water to drink and painful torment   a reward for their d
Ask   them     Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Mighty Throne   i   e   the Sovereign Authority of the entire universe    
But he who looks for more than that   then it is they who transgress the limits  
And We did not find   the fulfilment of   commitment in most of them and We found most of them but disobedient  
And in like manner their partners have made killing of their children appear attractive to many of the idolaters in order to ruin them   and   also   make their   leftover   religion doubtful for them   And had Allah willed   to prevent them forcefully   they could not have done it   So leave them alone   paying no heed to them   and that which they fabricate  
And there is not a thing   in the universe   but that We have its treasures with Us and We send it down only according to a fixed quantity  
And you cannot thwart Allah   anywhere   on earth   with your schemes     And   except Allah   none   of your idols   will be your guardian and helper  
And they hasten to demand from you punishment before mercy though many torments have passed before them   And     O Beloved     your Lord is Most Forgiving to the people despite their   oppression and   injustice   But certainly your Lord is Severe in punishment   as well    
And We ordained   Adam   reside you and your wife in this Paradise and eat of it   both of you   whatever you like and from wherever you will   But do not go near this tree lest you   join   the transgressors  
And no bearer of burden will bear anothers burden   of sins     And if someone heavily loaded calls   another   to share his load   nothing of his burden will be carried by him even though he be a close relative     O Beloved     You warn but those who fear their Lord unseen and establish Prayer   And whoever acquires purity does so to his own benefit   And to Allah is the return 
And on the Day when He gathers them all together   He will say     O party of jinn   satans     certainly you misguided many a human being   and their friends among mankind will say   O our Lord   We have   sufficiently   benefited from each other   and   in the same state of negligence and interest   mongering   reached the end of the term that You had fixed for us   but we could
No indeed   Do not pay any heed to his doings and     O Esteemed Beloved     persist in prostration and keep drawing near   Us more and more    
And Allah judges with truth   and the   idols   they worship other than Allah can judge nothing at all   Surely Allah is the One Who is All   Hearing   All   Seeing  
And if you are in doubt about this   Book   which We have revealed to Our   exalted   servant   then produce only one chapter like this   And   for this task   you may call upon   all   your helpers apart from Allah   if you are true   in your doubt and denial    
  That Hour   will lower   some   and raise   some others   high  
And surely We sent Nuh   Noah     to his people     He said to them     I am   raised and appointed as   a plain Warner to you  
And Allah calls towards the Home of Peace   Paradise     and guides whom He wills to the straight path  
  Maryam   Mary     said   How can there be a son to me whereas no man has even touched me   nor am I unchaste  
Neither they have any knowledge of it nor had their fathers   How dreadful is   this   utterance that is coming out of their mouths   They speak nothing but   sheer   falsehood  
And     O Believing Servant     if an evil whisper of Satan stirs your mind seek refuge with Allah   surely He is All   Hearing   All   Knowing  
And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and fears Allah and adopts Godwariness for Him   it is they who will achieve their goal  
And they say   We have believed in Allah and the Messenger and we obey   Then after   saying   this a group of them turns away   from their affirmation     And   in fact   these people are not   at all   believers  
O people   If you are in doubt about being raised up   after death   then   contemplate your creation and evolution    
Viewing   the enchanting radiance and beauty of   their Lord   unveiled    
But We see it very near  
Now you will find another category of people who desire to remain free of any threat from you   by hypocritically pretending to believe     and   also   live in peace from their own community   by siding with disbelievers secretly   But their true state is this that   whenever they are turned to mischief   and wickedness against Muslims   they plunge   headlong   into it   So if t
But he who kills a Muslim deliberately   his sentence will be Hell wherein will he abide for ages   Allah will afflict him with His wrath and will cast His curse on him   And He has prepared for him a dreadful torment  
Musa   Moses   said to him   Can I stay with you under this   condition   that you will teach me   as well   some of that knowledge which has been conferred on you for guidance  
O our Lord   We have believed in the Book which You have sent down and we have become the followers of this Messenger   So register us among those who bear witness   to the Truth    
Have they any gods apart from Us who can save them   from the torment     They do not have any power even to help themselves   Nor will they get any support and alliance from Us  
  Harun   Aaron     said   O son of my mother   seize me not by my beard or my head     In being harsh   I feared you would say   You have created division among the Children of Israel and have not safeguarded my word  
Surely   those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers and seek to discriminate between Allah and His Messengers and say   We believe in some and deny the others   and intend to find a way in between   belief and disbelief    
He will indeed admit them to that   station of divine pleasure   they will be well pleased with   And Allah is indeed All   Knowing   Most Forbearing  
By Allah   We certainly sent Messengers to   many   people before you   also     Then Satan made their   evil   deeds look attractive and pleasing to them   So the same   Satan   is today their friend   And for them there is painful punishment  
And there are others   who   have confessed their sins   They have mixed up good deeds with some bad ones   by mistake     Allah will   most likely   accept their repentance   Surely   Allah is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
But when that   torment   descends before them   how evil will be the morning of those who were warned  
  O Prophet     Convey to the hypocrites the news that a grievous torment awaits them  
But if they had believed and become God   fearing     even a little   reward from Allah would have been far better   than all these things     If they but knew   this secret    
These People of the Book did not dissent among themselves   with regard to believing in the Prophethood and Messengership of the last Messenger   Allah bless him and give him peace   and recognizing his holy status     until after the clear proof had come to them   of the Prophethood of Muhammad   Allah bless him and give him peace    
And We had in advance prohibited him from the feed of wet nurses   So   Musas   Mosess   sister   said   Shall I tell you about a family who will bring up this   child   for you and will   also   be his well   wisher  
Musa   Moses   said   This   agreement   is   settled   between me and you   Whichever of the two terms I complete   I will not be forced   And Allah is the Custodian over what we say  
  O Glorious Beloved     Indeed those against whom the judgment of your Lord has proved true will not believe  
And   you will wonder at them   if you see the sinners hanging down their heads before the Presence of their Lord   and saying     O our Lord   we have seen and heard   so send us back   to the world now   so that we do pious deeds   Surely we believe with certitude  
Sulaiman   Solomon   did not disbelieve   any way    
And   also   of His Signs is your sleep by night and by day and your looking for His Bounty   sustenance     Verily there are Signs in it for the   active   listeners  
All that are in the heavens and the earth beg from Him alone   Every moment His Glory manifests anew  
And relate to them the account of Nuh   Noah   when he said to his people   O my people   the children of Qabil   Cain       if my stay and my admonition to you by Allahs Revelations annoy you   then   bear in mind that   I have put my trust in Allah alone   and I am not afraid of you     Therefore   mature your plot   against me   jointly   and also   make   your   sculptured   p
And He is the One Who takes your souls by night and knows whatever you earn by day   and then wakes you up in the day   so that the appointed term   of your life   may be completed   Then to Him shall you return   Then   on the Day of Reckoning   He shall unfold to you   all those actions   which you used to do   during this term of life    
In spite of that those   Jews   used to learn such   magic   from both of them by which they caused separation between husband and wife  
And keep weighing justly and do not make the balance fall short  
And when Musa   Moses   came at the time   set   by Us and his Lord spoke to him he   ardently aspired to behold Him out of the pleasure of hearing Allahs Word and Voice and   submitted   O Lord   show me   Your Beauty   so that I may savour Your Sight   Allah said   By no means can you look upon Me   directly   but look towards the mountain   So if it stays firm in its place then
And who guard their Prayers   with persistence    
And there comes to them no Sign of the Signs of their Lord but   that   they turn away from it  
With a special favour from Us   In the same way We give reward to him who gives thanks  
And when he turns away   from you     he runs about in the land to do   everything possible   to rouse mischief and destroy crops and life   And Allah does not like mischief and violence  
So that We may give life with that to   any   dead city and   furthermore   We provide this   water   for drink to many cattle and   nomadic   people that We have created  
And     O people of Truth     continue your fight against these   chieftains of oppression and terrorism for the establishment of enduring peace     until there does not   remain   any disruption and Din   the system of compliance with law and promoting the phenomena of life   is devoted to Allah alone   And if they desist   then Allah is surely seeing well   the action   that the
When we held you equal to the Lord of all the worlds  
Their account is only with my Lord   If you could but understand   what the real honour and dishonour is    
And the Day when   Allah   will call to them He will say   What answer did you serve to the Messengers  
And He is the One Who has made the night a   wrapper   like   covering for you and made sleep   a means of   rest   for you   and the day a time to get up   for work    
Then Lut   Lot   believed in him   Ibrahim   Abraham     and he said   I am migrating towards my Lord   Surely He is Almighty   Most Wise  
Alif   Lam   Ra     Only Allah and the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   know the real meaning     These are the Verses of the Book which is all wisdom  
  The Messenger   said   Even though I bring you a way   and Din   Religion     better than that on which you found your fathers   They said   We deny whatever you have been sent with  
That is the   Command     And whoever venerates the Signs of Allah   i   e   honouring those living beings   shrines   monumental sites   commands and prescribed duties known and recognized due to some pious association or link with Allah or Allahs devoted servants     this   veneration   is of the Godwariness of hearts   only those venerate whose hearts have been blessed with fea
Chased by a succeeding convulsion  
Fire will be enclosed upon them   covering from all sides    
And this   has also been commanded     Establish Prayer and always fear Him   and Allah is He to Whom you   all   shall be gathered  
And neither did We give them   i   e   the residents of Makka   the revealed Books which they would recite   nor did We send to them any Warner before you  
And fear   the wrath of   Allah and do not humiliate me  
The Day when neither wealth nor sons will profit  
Ibrahim   Abraham   said   The truth is that your Lord Who created them   all   is the Lord of the heavens and the earth   and I am of those who bear witness to this   truth    
Whoever longs for   quick recompense for his labour in the form of   worldly riches alone   We readily grant whatever We like to whoever We please   here in this world   Thereafter   We have set up Hell for him which he will enter hearing condemnation and contempt   rejected   from the mercy of his Lord    
The   riches   that you possess will be no more and what is with Allah will last   And those who remain steadfast We shall certainly pay their recompense for their righteous deeds which they used to do  
And Our Command comes into action once and for all as the twinkling of an eye  
Do you build a monument on every high point   merely   for vanity and vain pursuits  
And We shall remove from their breasts all spite that they had   in the world against one another due to misunderstanding     They shall be brothers seated on couches face to face   in Paradise    
So which of your Lords blessings will you both deny  
And We called him out from the right of   Mount   Tur and blessed him with Our   special   nearness for secret converse  
  That will befall   from Allah   Who is the Lord of the Ascending Steps to Heaven   and of the higher ranks and grades of spiritual hierarchy    
And if you have the apprehension that you will not be able to treat the orphan girls justly then marry the women you like and who are lawful for you   two or three or four   but this sanction is conditional on justice     Then if you fear that you will not be able to treat   more than one wife   justly then   marry   only one woman or the maids who have come under your possession 
And Sulaiman   Solomon   succeeded Dawud   David   and said   O people   we have been taught the speech of birds   as well   and we have been granted everything   No doubt   this is most obvious Grace   of Allah    
And do not sit on every path to frighten everyone who has embraced faith in this   Call   and to hinder   him   from the path of Allah and to look for any crookedness in this   Message to make him feel frustrated and disgusted with the true Din   Religion       And remember   Allahs favour   when you were small in number and He multiplied you   and see what was the end of those wh
And     O people     the life of this world is nothing but sport and pastime and the Home of the Hereafter is the only   true   life   Would that they knew   this secret    
We have strong hope that our Lord will forgive our sins since it is we who are the first to believe   now    
O My Esteemed Beloved   This   narrative   is of the news of the unseen which We are revealing to you and you were not present with them when they   Yusuf   Josephs   brothers   were co   working to conclude their conspiracy and were plotting to deceive  
And among them   the Jews   some   are illiterate   as well   who do not know   even the bare minimum about the meaning and connotations of   the Book   except hearsay and false hopes     They know only to recite   the Book   verbally and follow mere speculation and assumption  
Neither can the sun   deviate from its orbit and   overtake the moon nor can the night precede the day and all   the stars and planets   are moving in their   respective   orbits  
And hold fast to the rope of Allah all of you together and do not generate dissension and factions   But call to mind the blessing of Allah upon you when you were enemies   one to another     Then He created the bond of love among your hearts   and by His blessing you became brothers   And you   had reached   the brink of a pit of Fire   of Hell   but He rescued you from it   That
  It runs thus     When Yusuf   Joseph   said to his father   O my venerable father   I have seen   in a dream   eleven stars and the sun and the moon   I have seen them prostrating themselves before me  
Say   If   supposing the impossible   the Most Kind Lord had a son   or children     I would have been the first one to worship   the same    
And   the servants of Paradise   will be   roaming about   with fruits which   the Near Ones   will like  
So   suck the juice of all kinds of fruit and then follow those routes   suggested   by your Lord   which lead to these fruits and flowers of which you are to suck the juice   leading other bees also to the source   for their convenience   There oozes from their bellies a syrup   that is honey   of diverse colours   It has healing properties for the people   Therein is indeed a Si
  So   whatever is in the heavens   i   e   the upper divine and celestial spheres and spatial terrestrial spheres   and whatever is in the earth and whatever is in between the two   i   e   the atmospheric spheres   and whatever is beneath the soil to its bed   all are   functioning in compliance with   His   command and control system    
And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct to you   separated   from the black thread   of night    
Then how   awful   My Torment and My Warning were  
  O people     Have you not seen that Allah has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth   and He has completed upon you His blessings outwardly as well as inwardly   And among people there are   also   those who dispute about Allah without knowledge and without guidance and without   any evidence from   the enlightening Book  
Certainly those who deny Revelations of Allah and kill the Prophets unjustly   and also kill those of the people who enjoin equity and justice   so announce to them the news of a grievous torment  
And   O my Lord   also I seek refuge with You lest they should come to me  
They said   O Lut   Lot     if you do not stop   saying these things     you will surely become of the exiled  
Then Ibrahim   Abraham   went up to their gods   idols   quietly and said to them   Do you not eat  
He overpowers only those who make friends with him and who associate partners with Allah  
Surely   you will in no way be able to influence My servants   who have attained this freedom from you   except the misguided lot who have adopted your way  
So always glorify the Name of your Lord   Most Magnificent  
And those who separate their wives by Zihar but then seek to go back on what they have said   setting free a neck   a slave or a slave girl   is obligatory before they touch each other   This is what you are admonished   And Allah is Well Aware of the works that you do  
He is the One Who endowed everything He created with perfection and virtue   And He initiated the genesis of man from clay   i   e   inorganic matter    
And never   ever   agree to what the disbelievers and hypocrites say     conclude with us a religious agreement     And disregard their hurtful misbehaviour   and maintain your trust in Allah   with persistence     And Allah alone is Sufficient as a Guardian   in the conflict between the Truth and falsehood    
And let it not occur to you at all that those who disbelieve and are ungrateful will make   Allah   powerless   to destroy them   in the earth   And Hell is their abode and the worst is that abode  
And of everything We have created two pairs so that you might concentrate and understand  
But   the truth is that   these   idols   are nothing but mere names which you and your fathers have given   Allah has not sent down any authority for them   They follow only whims and suspicions and the desires of their   ill   commanding   selves whereas Guidance has already come to them from their Lord  
And   We sent   to Madyan their   kinship   brother Shuaib   So he said   O my people   worship Allah and look forward to the Last Day and do not do mischief in the land  
Who fears the Most Kind   Lord   unseen and comes   before the Presence of Allah   with a heart turned in repentance  
And in this way We unveiled their   state   to those   who succeeded them some centuries later   so that they might know that Allahs promise is true and   also   that there is no doubt about the coming of the Last Hour     When these people of the cave died   and the people of the town developed a dispute concerning their matter   they said   Raise a building over their   cave as 
And when Our Command   of torment   came to pass   then   We saved Hud and the believers with him because of Our Mercy   and We delivered them from severe punishment  
And in the same way We showed Ibrahim   Abraham   all the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth   i   e   the wonders of Our creation   so that he might be one of those who possess the eye of certitude  
Likewise were wandering distracted those who used to deny the Revelations of Allah  
  So the same happened that he apprehended     The people of Lut   Lot   hearing about the arrival of the guests     came to him running   And they were already addicted to evil   doing   Lut   Lot   said   O my   disobedient   people   here are my   peoples   daughters   They are pure and lawful for you   through marriage     So   fear Allah and do not humiliate me before my gues
And   the People of the Book   say   No one will enter Paradise except he who is a Jew or a Christian   These are their false hopes   Say   Produce your proof   in favour of this desire   if you are rightful   in your claim    
Whereas there is no   burden of   responsibility on you even if he does not adopt purification   faith    
Say   Obey Allah and the Messenger   blessing and peace be upon him     But if they turn away then Allah does not like the disbelievers  
And the wretched one will avoid and evade it  
And by the angels that distribute work  
Indeed the one who purifies his   ill   commanding   self   from all vain and vicious desires and cultivates in it virtue and piousness   succeeds  
And it is this notion that you developed about your Lord which ruined you   So you became of the losers  
And also recite to them the story of Ibrahim   Abraham    
Do the disbelievers say   The Messenger has fabricated this   Quran   himself   Say   Bring then ten forged chapters like this   and call   to your help   whom you can except Allah if you are truthful

So which of your Lords blessings will you both deny  
He Who has created   everything in the Universe   and then   fulfilling all requisites   equipoised it to its exact proportion  
So if   even then   they turn away   O Glorious Messenger     then your responsibility is only to convey and communicate   My Message and My Commands   clearly  
By this Allah guides those who seek His pleasure to the paths to peace   and security     and takes them out of darkness   of ignorance and disbelief   by His Command   and leads them to the light   of faith and guidance   and directs them towards the straight road

And believe in   the Book   that I have revealed   to My Messenger Muhammad     blessing and peace be upon him     while it confirms   originally   that which you possess   And do not be the first to deny it nor barter My Revelations for a small   worldly   price   And fear Me alone  
And     O Blievers     if the disbelievers had fought with you   at al   Hudaibiya     they would certainly have fled turning their backs and found no friend and helper     But Allah intended to open the door to you not only of this but many other victories as well    
Blessed is He in Whose   Mighty   Hand is the Kingdom   of all the worlds     And He enjoys Perfect Command over everything

Its seal will be musk   And   it is this beverage which   all aspirants should hastily strive and compete to acquire     Some seek the drink of bliss while others long for the drink of nearness and still others yearn for the drink of countenance all will be served according to their respective tastes    
If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is the disease   of malice and insolence against the Holy Prophet   blessings and peace be upon him     and   likewise   those who spread false rumours in Madina do not desist   then We shall certainly make you overmaster them   Then they will not be able to stay in the neighbourhood of Madina but for a few   days    
And the people of the city   possessed by their lust   approached   Lut   Lot     rejoicing  
And say   Are our gods better or he   Isa   Jesus       They say this only to have a dispute with you   No doubt   they are highly quarrelsome  
The Day when Allah will raise up all of them   giving life a second time   they will swear to Him   as well   as they swear to you   And they assume that they are on a   right   thing   i   e   path     Beware   They are liars  
And have they not seen that We stream water towards the dry land   then with that We produce crops of which their cattle as well as they themselves eat   Do they not observe  
He said   The knowledge   of the Hour of the torment   is with Allah alone   And I am only transmitting to you the injunctions which I have been sent with   But I can see that you are an ignorant people  
  O My Esteemed Beloved     Continue observing patience with what they say and remember Our servant Dawud   David     who had great power   Certainly he was ever   turning   to Us in repentance    
On the Day when Allah will raise them up   giving life again     He will then inform them of their actions   Allah has counted up   their   every action while they have forgotten it   And Allah is Witness over   and Well Aware of   everything  
Alif   Lam   Mim   Ra     Only Allah and the Messenger know the real meaning     These are the Verses of the Book of Allah   and whatever has been revealed to you from your Lord is the Truth   but most people do not believe  
O Believers   Fit out for your safeguard   then set out as separate units or march off all together   to stirve hard and eliminate militancy and terrorism    
Forbidden to you are your mothers   your daughters   your sisters   your fathers sisters and your mothers sisters and your brothers daughters and sisters daughters and your mothers   who   have suckled you   your foster sisters and mothers of your wives   And   similarly   your stepdaughters brought up under your parentage born of your women with whom you have had marital relation
Except those who turn to Allah in repentance before you overpower them   So   know that Allah is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
They are deaf   dumb and blind   So they will not return   to the right path    
Say   O people   if you are in any doubt   about the authenticity of   my Din   Religion     then   listen   that I cannot worship those   idols   whom you worship besides Allah   But I worship that Allah Who causes you to die   And I have been commanded that I must   always   be from among the believers  
So which of your Lords blessings will you both deny  
Whether or not you seek forgiveness for these   wicked and arrogant hypocrites who dare scoff at your eminence     if you implore forgiveness for them seventy times   out of your natural compassion and your benevolent practice of forgiving and forbearing     even then Allah will not forgive them at all because they have rejected Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upo
And your Lord is not such that He would destroy the towns wrongfully while their dwellers are pious  
So what have you learnt about what the Day of Recompense is  
Then who denies you after this regarding Din   Religion or the Last Hour and reward and punishment    
When that Day comes   not a soul will be able to speak without His permission   Then some of them will be unfortunate and others fortunate  
And those who do not hope for meeting with Us say   Why were angels not sent down to us   Or if we could see our Lord   with our own eyes   we would certainly believe     In fact they esteem   themselves   very highly in their hearts and are rebelling beyond bounds  
O Believers   Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet   blessings and peace be upon him   and   also   do not speak to him so loud as you are loud when you speak to one another   lest   all your actions should come to nothing   including your faith     and you are not even aware   that your faith and all pious works have been wrecked    
So today     O hypocrites     no recompense will be accepted from you or from those who disbelieved   Hell is the abode for you   all     And it is this   abode   which is your mawla   i   e   companion     And quite an evil resort is that     because you denied accepting those as mawla from whom the charity of the light of faith and forgiveness is obtained    
Surely We sent upon them a howling windstorm on a day of lasting evil   in their favour    
And surely those who do not believe in the Hereafter remain deviated from the   straight   path  
O People   Worship your Lord Who created you and   also   those who were before you   so that you become God   wary  
Before them the people of Nuh   Noah   and after them many   other   communities rejected   their Messengers     And every people intended to seize its Messenger   to assassinate or imprison him   and raised dispute through baseless issues to dilute   the influence of   the Truth by means of that   dispute     So I seized them   in torment     So how was   My   torment  
And remember that the Messenger of Allah   blessings and peace be upon him   is among you   If he accepted what you say in most of the matters   you would be in serious trouble   But Allah has blessed you with the love of faith and has embelished it in your hearts and has made you hate disbelief   disobedience and sins   Such are they that follow the path of Din   Religion   resol
And those who safeguard their trusts and promises  
And     O Esteemed Beloved     We sent only men   as Prophets   before you   also     We used to send them Revelations   So     O people     if you do not know   yourselves     ask the people of remembrance  
In the same way your Lord will choose you   for a divine station   and will teach you how to infer conclusions   i   e   the knowledge of the interpretation of dreams   and will perfect His Favour upon you and the House of Yaqub   Jacob   as He perfected it upon your fathers   grandfather and great grandfather   Ibrahim   Abraham   and Ishaq   Isaac     Indeed your Lord is All   K
  Everything   in the heavens and in the earth glorifies Allah     the Real   King   the Most Pure   of all shortcomings and imperfections     the Lord of Honour   the Almighty   the Most Wise  
This is a   great   Sura which We have revealed and We have made its   Commandments   obligatory   And We have sent down in it clear Revelations so that you may take direction and guidance  
O my Lord   Forgive me and   forgive   my parents and all the believers as well on the Day when reckoning   and accountability   will be held  
And verily your Lord alone is Almighty   Ever   Merciful  
And     O Beloved   We have enjoined that   you should judge between them by this   Commandment   which Allah has revealed and do not follow their desires   And be on your guard against them lest they tempt you away from any of   the commandments   which Allah has revealed to you   But if they turn away   from your judgment   then know that Allah intends to punish them for some of
So Musa   Moses     afraid and waiting for   Allahs help     went off from there   He prayed   O my Lord   deliver me from the oppressing people  
It is indeed the Glorious Quran  
Nuh   Noah   said   O my people   what is your view   if I stick to a Clear Proof from my Lord and He has also granted me His   exceptional   Mercy from Himself but that has been veiled from you   like the blind     can we force it upon you coercively while you despise it  
And when   tightly bound   together or bound to their satans     they will be thrown into it from some narrow place   then they will cry out for   their   destruction  
Have you taken a look at   the goddesses   Lat and Uzza  
And when it is said to them   Believe in this   Book   which Allah has   now   revealed   they say   We believe only in that   Book   which was revealed to us   and they deny all other than that   whereas this   Quran   is   also   the Truth   and   confirms that   Book as well   which they possess   Ask   them     Then why have you been killing the Prophets of Allah before this i
And We granted him out of Our Mercy his brother Harun   Aaron     making him a Prophet   to assist him in his task    
And by the moon when it follows the sun   reflects sunshine    
Say   Travel through the earth and see   with a warned eye   what has been the end of those who denied   the Truth    
Now Musa   Moses   felt a sort of hidden fear in his heart  
Then they will confess their sin   So remoteness for the inmates of Hell   from Allahs Mercy   is   destined    
When there comes to them any news of peace or fear   they spread it around   Had they referred it to the Messenger   blessing and peace be upon him   or those of them who are in command   instead of making it public     then those among them who can draw conclusion from some matter would have found it   i   e   the truth of the news     Had there not been Allahs Favour to you and 
And before you also We sent men alone from among the inhabitants of   various   towns to whom We sent Revelations   Have they not travelled in the land so that they might   themselves   witness what was the end of those before them   And surely the Home in the Hereafter has far greater value for the Godfearing   Do you not have reason  
And   in particular   from the evil of murky night when   its   darkness prevails  
  All these favours are put together   so that He may admit the believing men and women to the Gardens with streams flowing under them   They will live in them forever   And   moreover   He may remove from them their evil actions   as He has forgiven them their mistakes     And this is a great success   of the believers   in the sight of Allah  
And the disbelievers will always remain in doubt about this   Holy Quran   until the Last Hour comes suddenly upon them or the torment of the Day from which salvation is least possible  
And there did not come to them any Messenger but they would mock him  
And indeed Our deputed angels came to Ibrahim   Abraham   bearing glad tidings   They greeted him   saying   Peace   be on you     and Ibrahim   Abraham   reciprocated   Peace   be on you     Then he did not take any time and brought   them   a roasted calf   in hospitality    
And call to mind the Favour of Allah   conferred   upon you   and   also recall   the promise which He took from you   under affirmation   when you declared   agreeing     We heard   Allahs Command   and we obeyed   it     And always fear Allah   Verily Allah knows best   the secrets of   hearts  
  That is   the people of Pharaoh   Do they not fear   Allah    
I will   for sure   lead them estray   arouse in them foul aspirations and keep directing them   So they will definitely incise the ears of cattle   And indeed I shall command them persistently   So they will surely alter what Allah has created   And whoever forsakes Allah and takes Satan for a friend suffers most certainly a perceptible loss  
Do you approach men rather than women to satisfy your sexual desire   The truth is that you are ignorant people  
Except for those who repent after this   false blaming   and mend their ways   Then Allah is verily Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful     They will not be counted among the disobedient   but this will not exempt them from hadd al   qadhaf   the penalty for false accusation      
Well   Who originates creation and shall repeat the same   process of creation   and Who grants you sustenance from the heavens and the earth   Is there any   other   God besides Allah   Say     O polytheists     bring your proof if you are truthful  
And proclaimed the chiefs   and the lords   of his people   too   who disbelieved and rejected the meeting of the Hereafter and whom We had   also   given prosperity   on account of riches and abundant wealth   in worldly life   they said to the people     He is only a human being like you   He eats what you eat and drinks what you drink  
O Muslims   They   the hypocrites   swear by Allah before you to keep you pleased whereas Allah along with His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   has a greater right that they should please Him   If they are the believers     they should have known this fact and should have pleased the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     Allah is pleased only if the Messenge
  Thereupon the angels   said   O Lut   Lot     we are the messengers of your Lord   These people shall never be able to get at you   So leave in a part of the night with your family and let not any of you look   back     but   do not take   your wife   with you     The same   torment   which will come upon them is going to reach her   too     Surely   the time appointed for their
And we indulged in vain activities with those who had cast themselves into vain activities  
And when they will fall out with one another in Hell   the weak will say to those who used to show arrogance   in the world     We were your followers   so can you remove from us   even   a portion of the Fire of Hell  
So We have indeed made this   Quran   easy in your own tongue so that   by means of it   you may communicate good news to the God   fearing and may warn thereby the contentious people  
When two groups from amongst you   Banu Salma Khazraj and Banu Haritha Aws   intended to go coward although Allah was their Ally   And the believers must have trust in Allah alone  
And winked at one another when they passed by them  
And Musa   Moses   said   If you and all others on earth disbelieve   then Allah is indeed Self   Sufficient   Most Praisworthy  
And certainly We sent Musa   Moses   with Our Signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs   He said   Indeed I am the Messenger of the Lord of all the worlds  
And had it not been the favour of my Lord I   too   would have joined those who are brought   for torment with you    
Then after them a characterless people succeeded   them   who inherited the Book   These   successors   take   as bribe   the wealth and riches of this base   world   and say   Soon shall we be forgiven   while if more of similar riches come to them   they will take that too   Was the promise of the Book   of Allah   not taken from them that they would not say of Allah   anything 
Today We shall seal their mouths   and their hands will speak to Us   and their feet will bear witness to the deeds which they used to earn  
Have they not seen that We created for them cattle out of the   Creation   We made with Our Mighty Hand   so they are their owners  
Say   We believe in Allah and in that which has been sent down to us and in that which has been revealed to Ibrahim   Abraham     Ismail   Ishmael     Ishaq   Isaac   and Yaqub   Jacob   and their descendants and that which has been given to Musa   Moses     Isa   Jesus   and all other Messengers by their Lord   we believe in all     We do not make distinction in our faith in anyo
Say   My Lord has declared unlawful only   all   the indecent acts which become known and which remain hidden and sins and unjust excesses   and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down any authority   and   in addition   saying such things about   the Essence of   Allah as you do not know yourselves  
No suffering afflicts   anyone   except by the Command of Allah   And he who believes in Allah   He guides his heart and Allah knows best everything  
And the man who had believed said   O my people   follow me   I will lead you to the path of guidance and piousness  
And verily   on the Day of Resurrection   you will come to Us all alone as We created you   all alone   the first time   and you will leave all that behind you which We have bestowed on you   of wealth and children     And We will not see your intercessors accompanying you whom you have assumed to be Our partners in your affairs   Surely   today   your mutual relation   and confid
So if you come upon them in the battlefield   then by killing them   for violating peace treaty   in an exemplary manner   make those   also   run on their heels who are behind them   so that they may learn a lesson of warning  
O Believers   Be steadfast and in perseverance   and tenacity   toil   even harder than the enemy   and be alert and vigilant   for struggle against violation of peace and human rights     and   always   persist in fearing Allah so that you may achieve success  
O Yahya   John     Hold fast to   Our   Book   the Torah     And We granted him wisdom and vision   Prophethood   while yet a child  
  Comparing himself with the Prophet     he said   I am better than he   You have created me from fire and You have created him from clay  
I want   I commit no offence and   you take my sin   i   e   sin of killing me     and also your own sin   the preceding one on account of which your offering has been rejected all   on you   You will then become one of the inmates of Hell   And that is but the punishment of the wrongdoers  
And the disbelievers say   Why have Signs not been sent down on him   the Holy Prophet   blessings and peace be upon him     from his Lord   Say   The Signs are with Allah alone and I am simply an open Warner  
We have indeed believed in our Lord in order that He may forgive us our sins and also   may forgive   that sorcery to which you forced us   and Allah is the Best and Ever   Abiding  
And forgive my father   Surely he was of the misguided  
And when I imbued the hearts of the disciples with   this     Believe in Me and My Messenger   Isa   Jesus       they said   We believe and bear witness that we are certainly Muslims  
So the Day when they will see it   they   will feel as if they   did not tarry   in the world   but for one evening or one morning  
And   after Ismail   Ishmael     We gave him the good news of Ishaq   Isaac     He was   also   a Prophet   one of the most pious  
You will indeed find the Jews and the polytheists the bitterest of people in their enmity against the Muslims   and the closest in love and affection for the Muslims you will find those who say   Indeed we are Nazarenes   Christians     This is because among them are savants   i   e   scholars of Sharia   as well as monks   i   e   ascetic worshippers   and   moreover   they are n
Then when he saw the moon shining   he asked   Is this my Lord   according to your view     But when that   also   went down   he said   communicating to his people     Had my Lord not guided me   I would surely have become   like you   one of those who go astray  
That Allah has begotten children and surely they are liars  
Except the chosen servants of Allah  
And by   Mount   Tur of Sinai  
But if they turn away   then surely Allah knows the miscreants full well  
Both appear deep green tinting black  
And we have brought to you   the judgment of   the Truth and we are certainly truthful  
Nuh   Noah   said   Allah alone will bring upon you that   torment   if He so wills and you cannot hinder   Him    
And   the second example is given of   Maryam   Mary     the daughter of Imran   who guarded well her chastity and purity   And We breathed Our Spirit into the sternal opening of   her   shirt   And she confirmed the Commandments of her Lord and the   revealed   Books and she was of the obedient  
Verily   those who have believed   and   those who were   Jews and Christians and Sabians   those   of them   who believe in Allah and the Last Day and act piously   there is for them their reward with their Lord   Neither shall any fear obsess them   nor shall they grieve  
Then the one who had some knowledge of the   heavenly   Book submitted   I can bring it to you before your vision turns back to you   i   e   even before the twinkling of an eye     So   when   Sulaiman   Solomon     saw it   the throne   placed before him   he said   This is by the Grace of my Lord so that He may put me to the test whether I thank   Him   or not   And he who than

How can their accepting the admonition now be   of any use   whereas there came to them a Messenger with clear exposition  
And some women of   the elite class in   the city began to say   The wife of Aziz seeks to seduce her slave   boy for her purpose   The love for him   the slave   has gone deep into her heart   We surely see her in manifest error  
Unclean women are   particular   for unclean men while unclean men are meant for unclean women   And   likewise   clean and chaste women are   specific   to clean and pious men while clean and pious men are exclusively for clean and chaste women     So keeping in view the holiness   sanctity and purity of the Holy Prophet   you yourselves could imagine how pure   wholesome and cha

And the Jews and the Christians shall   by no means   be pleased with you   till   you follow their religion   Say   Surely   the guidance   given   by Allah only is the   real   guidance

Those of the Muslims who   shirking fight   stay back   home   without any stressful condition   excuse     and those who fight in the cause of Allah with their material as well as human resources cannot be equal   in their reward and grading     Allah has exalted in rank those who fight in the cause of Allah with their material as well as human resources above those who stay back
So neither their wealth nor their children should amaze you   It is for these   things   only that Allah intends to punish them in the life of this world and that their souls may depart while they are in a state of disbelief  
They will say   Yes indeed   A Warner did come to us but we rejected him and said   Allah has not sent down anything   You are just in great error

And undoubtedly they are provoking us  
And they say   What is the matter with this Messenger   He eats food and walks about in the marketplaces   Why has an angel not been sent down to him that he might   join   him as a Warner  
She said   Amazing   Shall I bear a child while I have grown old and my husband   too   is an old man   It is extremely astonishing indeed

In this manner We continue making some of the oppressors dominate over others due to the   evil   deeds that they earn  
If Allah helps you   none can overpower you   but if He abandons you taking away all support   then who is it that can help you after Him   And the believers should rely on Allah alone  
And surely the evildoers will be in the   Blazing Fire of   Hell  
Surely he has no control   at all   over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord  
And   Allah   is He Who has created you from a single soul   i   e   a single cell     Then   for you   there   is   a place of residing and a place of storage   i   e   the mothers womb and the world or the world and the grave respectively     Surely We have explained the Signs   of Our Power and Might   in detail for the people who understand

Nor can you turn   these   blind   wanting in insight   from misguidance to the path of guidance   You recite   with the essential understanding and competence of acceptability   only to those people who believe in Our Revelations   So it is they who are Muslims     You recite to none except them

When there comes Allahs help and victory  
And not a Sign of the Signs of their Lord comes to them but they turn away from it  
And those who have adopted Godwariness Allah will deliver them bestowing success on them   No evil will touch them   nor will they grieve at all  
The one who disbelieves after having believed   except someone who is coercively forced to do so and at heart remains contented with belief   as before     but   of course   he who   adopts   disbelief   afresh   wholeheartedly with an open mind   on them is wrath from Allah and for them is fierce torment  
  Say     Should I look for someone other than Allah as authority   and judge   while He   Allah   is the One Who has revealed to you the elaborate Book   comprising a clear course of action     And those whom We gave the Book   before   know   with conviction   that this   Quran   has been revealed from your Lord   based on   Truth   So do not be of the sceptics   with regard to

And those who spend their wealth to seek Allahs pleasure and stabilize themselves   in faith and obedience   are like a garden located on a higher ground level   When a heavy rain falls on it   it doubles its yield   And if it does not receive a heavy rain then even dew   or drizzle   is sufficient   And Allah monitors your actions minutely  
So that I may do some righteous works in that   world   which I have left behind   No way   He will be saying this   only in despair     And ahead of them is a barrier   erected   till the Day   when   they will be raised up   from the graves    
This is   one favour and bestowal     and   the other is that   Allah does weaken the plots and deceitful strategies of the disbelievers  
So who is more unjust than one who fabricates lies against Allah or belies His Revelations   Certainly the evildoers will never triumph  
These are the people who   remembering Allah   remain standing   as the epitome of submissiveness     sitting   as reverence incarnate   and   also keep   changing sides   in discomfort of love   and meditate on   manifest lustre of His Eminence and Beauty at work in   the creation of the heavens and the earth     Then acquainted with the pleasure of His gnosis   they call out spo
But you are not focusing your attention on him  
And   now   they say   because of the same respite     Why has some   decisive   Sign not been sent down to this   Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     from his Lord   Say   The unseen is for Allah alone   So wait   I too am with you among those who wait  
Righteousness is not merely that you turn your faces to the East or the West   But true righteousness is that a person believes in Allah   the Last Day   the angels   the Book   revealed by Allah   and the Messengers  
What is the matter with you that you do not speak  
And in fact We sent before you Prophets to their respective peoples and they came to them with clear Signs   Then We took revenge on the wicked   who belied and disbelieved     and to help the believers was   and is   a binding obligation upon Our Grace  
And assuredly for you there is a reward that will never end  
Whatever of   the treasure of   His Mercy Allah opens to mankind there is none who can withhold it   And whatever He withholds then after this there is none who may release it   And He alone is Almighty   Most Wise  
So today he does not have any warm friend  
Enter the gates of Hell   You will live in it forever   So how evil is the abode of the arrogant  
Then has He not the power to give life to the dead again  
And spend in the cause of Allah   and do not cast yourselves into destruction with your own hands   and adopt righteousness   Verily   Allah loves the righteous  
And remain in your houses with calm and peace and do not display adornment like that of the days of ignorance and establish Prayer and pay Zakat   the Alms   due   and keep obeying Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     Allah intends only to remove all impurity of sins from you   O People of the House   of the Prophet     even a doubt or trace of shortfall  
The People of Nuh   Noah   also denied before this   So they belied Our servant   Nuh Noah   the Messenger   and said     He   is mad   And he was given threats  
Allah will not hold you accountable for your vain oaths but will take you to task for the oaths taken with serious intention in your hearts   And Allah is Most Forgiving   Most Forbearing  
And whoever turns away from My Direction and Guidance   remembrance and advice     his worldly sustenance will be narrowed and We will raise him blind on the Day of Resurrection   as well    
So that Allah may remove from them errors which they did and may grant them the reward for the pious deeds they used to do  
Why not   Indeed his Lord is ever watching him  
So a terrible destruction awaits the disbelievers on that Day of theirs which they have been promised  
O Believers   Fear Allah as it is due to fear Him   And death should approach you only in a state when you are Muslim  
And have they not taken any guidance   from this proclamation   that how many generations We have destroyed before them in whose dwellings these people   now   move about   Surely there are Signs in it   So do they not hear  
That is the Truth   but   on the contrary you deny the Day of Recompense  
Surely this   Hell   is one of the greatest calamities  
  O Believers     Indeed Allah has prescribed for you how to dissolve your oaths   by atonement     And Allah is your Helper and Protector   And He is All   Knowing   Most Wise  
In Paradise there will   also   be chaste spouses for them and they shall abide there forever  
Has the news not reached you of those who disbelieved before you and tasted the punishment of their work   in the world   and there is grievous torment for them   in the Hereafter as well    
They will move about in that   Hell   and in the boiling hot water  
But those who disbelieve and deny Our Revelations   they are the people who will be   on fire   in Hell  
They said   By Allah   you are certainly in the   same   ecstasy of your   old   love  
And for those who swear not to go near their wives   there is a   reconsideration   period of four months   So   if   during this period   they resume their relations   Allah is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
Indeed the same way do we We reward the pious  
And it is not Allahs Glory to lead a people astray after guiding them aright   until He makes clear to them the things which they should guard against   Surely Allah knows best everything  
Say   Are you trying to show off to Allah your Din   Religion   while Allah knows all that is in the heavens and in the earth   And Allah is Well Aware of everything  
And We taught Dawud   David   the art of making the coats of mail for you to protect you from injury in your battle   Are you then grateful  
This   night   is   absolute   peace and security till daybreak  
I will assuredly approach them from their front   from their rear   from their right and from their left and   consequently   You will not find most of them grateful  
And of those whom We have created there is   also   a section   of people   who direct others towards the Truth   and alongside that make judgments based on justice  
  Musa   Moses     added     The One Who   is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers   too    
And they   the disbelievers and polytheists   ascribe daughters to Allah   Glory be to Him     He is far above that     and for themselves they prefer what they desire   i   e   sons    
  O Beloved     Whatever is said to you are the same Words that have been said to the Messengers before you   Surely your Lord is Most Forgiving and the Master of agonizing chastisement   as well    
A feeling of uneasiness came upon his   holy   face and he turned aside his   radiant   face  
Surely those who do not believe in the Hereafter   We have made their   evil   deeds appear fascinating   to them     So they wander distracted   in error    
And Ibrahim   Abraham   said   You have taken up the worship of idols leaving Allah merely for the sake of mutual friendship in the life of this world   Then on the Day of Resurrection   each   one of you will deny   the friendship of   the other and   each   one of you will curse the other   Hell is your abode and there will be no helper for you  
Both of them submitted   O our Lord   We have wronged our souls   And if You do not forgive us and have mercy on us   we shall certainly be among the losers  
O Believers   Whenever you strike deals with one another for a fixed period   reduce the transaction to writing  
And surely We blessed Luqman with wisdom and sound judgment   and said to him     Be grateful to Allah   And whoever gives thanks   thanks for his own good and whoever attempts ingratitude then surely Allah is Self   Sufficient     Himself   Worthy of all praise  
And do not marry women whom your fathers and forefathers married   But that which has passed   before this command is forgiven     It is indeed highly indecent   infuriating and an evil custom  
And it   the Quran   is direction and guidance for all the worlds  
By no means   He shall certainly be cast into al   Hutama   the crushing up Fire    
Certainly the believers have attained their goal  
And he who does so wrongs his own soul  
I will soon cast him into Hell  
And raised   up couches   laid    
Then   drawing this   shadow   little by little towards Ourselves   We roll it up  
And   always   establish Prayer and pay Zakat   the Alms   due   regularly   And whatever virtue you will send ahead   you shall find it with Allah   Surely Allah is watching all that you are doing  
And   also   other jinn bound in chains  
They seek the torment from you in haste and surely Hell is about to besiege the disbelievers  
And whatever spoils   materials of fai   the spoils   Allah restored to His Messenger     blessings and peace be upon him   taking out   from them   you galloped neither horses nor camels in   procuring   them   Yes indeed   Allah gives dominance and control to His Messengers over anyone He wills   And Allah has Absolute Power over everything  
From what stuff has Allah created him  
  It is they   who used to hinder   the people   from the path of Allah and look for crookedness in it and they disbelieved in the Hereafter  
And the decision of the matter in which you differ rests only with Allah   That is Allah   my Lord   In Him I put my trust   and to Him alone I turn  
So eat of the lawful and wholesome spoils of war you have obtained and keep fearing Allah   Surely   Allah is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
  O Muslims     Say   We believe in Allah and in that   Book   which has been revealed to us and   also   that which was revealed to Ibrahim   Abraham   and Ismail   Ishmael   and Ishaq   Isaac   and Yaqub   Jacob   and their children and those   Books   too which were given to Musa   Moses   and Isa   Jesus   and   likewise   which were given to other Prophets by their Lord  
Say to those who disbelieve   If they desist   from their blasphemous acts   then the   sins   which have passed before will be forgiven   But if they repeat the same then the pattern of   multiple punishments given to   the forerunners has passed     They will also be dealt with the same way    
And verily Nuh   Noah   cried to Us   So how excellent We are to respond to the prayers  
And We bestowed blessings on him and on Ishaq   Isaac     And among their descendants are both the virtuous as well as those who expressly wrong themselves  
Then   it was said to them     Taste My punishment and warning  
Surely   He is Most Relenting   Ever   Merciful  
  They   are such people as will be driven headlong towards Hell   It is they who are the worst ones as for their abode and are   also   much distracted from the   straight   path

And do you erect strongly   built palaces   having pools   with the hope of living   in the world   forever  
And those who disbelieve   for them is destruction and   Allah   has ruined their actions  
That it is they who have been granted help  
  The Guards of Hell or the inmates of Hell already there will say     This is an   other   army which is rushing into Hell along with you   There is no welcome for them   Surely they   too   are about to enter Hell  
And there are some people who dispute about Allah without any knowledge and understanding and follow every disobedient Satan  
And     O Godfearing folk     this is the Paradise of which you have been made the owners   a recompense of those   works   which you used to do  
And   recall   when your Lord proclaimed   If you thank   I shall certainly increase   My blessings on   you   and if you are ungrateful   then My torment is surely severe  
In them are two kinds of every fruit  
Surely Allah is the One with Whom is the knowledge of the Last Hour   And He is the One Who sends down rain and knows whatever is in the wombs   And no one knows what   deed   he will earn the next day nor does any one know in what land he will die   Surely Allah is All   Knowing   All   Aware   i   e   Self   Knowing and fully Aware of everything besides Him   He Himself Knows ev

It is made lawful for you to approach your wives during the nights of the fasts  
Around her neck will be   the same   palm   fibre rope   which she uses to bind the bunch of thorny twigs    
Whereas they were commanded to worship only Allah   making their Din   faith and devotion   sincerely His   dissociating from every falsehood     to establish Prayer and to pay Zakat   the Alms   due   regularly   And this is the straight and firm Din   Religion

Have We not made the earth a place to stay for   life   and to earn living and deeds  
Have they not seen those   shady   objects which Allah has created   their shadows keep crawling on the right and the left sides prostrating themselves before Allah   And     in fact   in this way   they display humbleness and obedience  
Those   misguided people   will say while disputing among themselves   in the Hell    
And they   the Jews   did not appreciate Allah with the just estimation that is His true measure   when they denied the Prophethood of Muhammad   blessings and peace be upon him     saying   Allah has not sent down anything to any human being   Say   Who sent down the Book which Musa   Moses   brought   a light and guidance for the people   You have made them into separate paper  
Those who associate partners with Allah will soon say   Had Allah so willed   neither we nor our fathers would have committed polytheism   nor would have we declared anything forbidden   without authority     In like manner the people before them also belied until they tasted Our torment   Say   Do you have any   authentic   knowledge which you may bring forth for us     If so   t

And   O my people   what has happened to me that I call you to salvation and you call me to Hell

And   also   because of their uttering   the boastful claim     We   have   killed Allahs Messenger   the Messiah   Isa son of Maryam   Jesus son of Mary     whereas they neither killed nor crucified him   But   in truth   someone was made the like   of Isa Jesus   in their view   But those who disagree about him have surely fallen prey to doubt   concerning   this   murder     Th

  O Believers     You shall most certainly be tested in your possessions and your selves   And of course you shall have also to hear many torturing   taunts   from those who were given the Book before you and who are polytheists   But if you remain patient and stick to self   protection   that is one of the works demanding high resolve

O my people   Enter the holy land   of Syria or Bait al   Maqdis   Jerusalem     which Allah has decreed for you   and do not turn back   in retreat   or you will turn back as losers  
And surely he led great many of you astray   so had you not any wisdom  
Have you not seen how your Lord treated   the people of Ad    
On the Day of Resurrection he will lead his people and will ultimately bring them down into the Fire of Hell   And how evil that place is to be ushered into  
Indeed We also showed him the way   to understanding and insight for distinguishing between the Truth and falsehood   whether he   now   becomes thankful or continues to be ungrateful  
Who denies   Din   Religion   of Truth   and turns away   from obedience to the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him      
Or   the disbelievers deeds are like   the darkness in a deep sea covered by a wave   rolled upon   yet   by another wave and above that are clouds     This   darkness is   in layers   one over another   When   a person drowning into such a sea   stretches his hand out     none   can see it   And he for whom Allah has not formed any light   of guidance     for him there is no ligh
And do not give to the people their things   weighing   less than what is due   nor provoke strife in the land   by such moral   economic and social corruption and fraud    
On this Maryam   Mary   pointed to   the baby     They said   How can we talk to him who is   yet   an infant in the cradle  
This Day I have bestowed upon them   this   reward for their patience that they have triumphed  
When   all   the heavenly spheres will be split apart  
And there is no moving creature   living being   on the earth but   that   its sustenance is   a bountiful obligation   upon Allah   And He knows its resting   place and   also   the place where it is to be entrusted   Everything is   recorded   in the enlightening Book   the Protected Tablet     al   Lawh al   Mahfuz      
You will see the wrongdoers fearing those   deeds   that they have earned   And that   torment   is bound to befall them   And they who believe and persist in pious deeds will be in the gardens of Paradise   There will be for them with their Lord   all those blessings   which they will long for   That is indeed a great Bounty  
Say   My Lord has enjoined justice   And set your direction aright   towards the Kaba   on every occasion and place of prostration   And worship Him devoting your obedience sincerely to Him alone   As He has originated your   creation and life   so will you return   towards Him    
He is the Ever   Living   There is no God but He   So worship Him making obedience and devotion sincerely His   All praise belongs to Allah alone   the Lord of all the worlds  
And your Lord knows   all   what their breasts hide   inside   and what they make known  
  That tree   yields fruit at all times by the Command of its Lord   and Allah illustrates examples for the people so that they may take advice  
  Their torment   was nothing but a Mighty Blast   and there were they put out   dead like charred coal    
And by the earth which will split asunder   and change into dust particles    
Allah said   O Musa   Moses     cast it down   on the ground    
Then he   the inmate of Paradise   will say   Will you peep down to see   him in which plight he is    
Yet they are in doubt   busy playing  
And indeed We sent a Messenger in every people     O people     worship Allah and keep away from Taghut   i   e   Satan and idol   worship     Then some among them were those whom Allah guided   and there were others among them for whom misguidance proved   appropriate     So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who belied   the Truth    
So all the sorcerers were assembled at the appointed time on the fixed day  
And when Satan made the actions of these   disbelievers   appear attractive to them and he said   to them     None of the people   can   overpower you today and I am certainly your protector   helper     But when both the armies stood   face to face   against each other   he turned on his heels and said   I am indeed averse to you   Certainly I see what you do not see   Surely I f
And you used to long for death   of a martyr   before you faced it   So now you have seen it in front of your own eyes  
Soon I will afflict him with   the punishment of   a severe toil  
That plucked out people as if they were uprooted stems of date   palms  
Do you have any Book with you in which you read   this    
And Musa   Moses   chose seventy men of his people for a time set by Us   to appear before Our Presence for forgiveness     but when a high   scale earthquake seized them   as punishment for not forbidding the people to perpetrate evil     Musa   Moses   submitted   O Lord   If You willed You would destroy these people and me even before this   Will You cause us to perish for that
So fear Allah as much as you are able to   And listen to   His Commands   and obey and spend   in His way     That will be better for you   And whoever is saved from the miserliness of his   ill   commanding   self   so it is they who will attain to prosperity  
And indeed before you   also   We destroyed   a number of   communities when they perpetrated injustice   And their Messengers brought to them clear Signs but they would not believe   That is how We punish the evildoers   for their impious behaviour    
And He   Allah   is the One Who created the heavens and the earth   the higher and the lower strata of the universe   in six days   i   e   six phases or aeons of creation and evolution     And   before the creation of the earth   His Throne of Authority operated on water     and from that He brought forth all manifestations of life and created you     so that He might put you to 
And He made you the owners of the land   the houses and the wealth and properties of these   war enemies   and the   captured   territory where you had not even stepped in   before     And Allah has Absolute Power over everything  
Every soul has to taste death   and We make you undergo foul and fair for trial   and towards Us will you be returned  
So fear Allah and obey me  
So which of your Lords blessings will you both deny  
Is it they about whom you used to swear   on seeing their miserable plight     Allah will   never   bless them with His Mercy     But listen   It is they who are now being called     Enter Paradise   you will neither fear nor grieve  
  Pharaoh   said   You have believed in Him before I granted you permission   Surely it is he   Musa   Moses     who is your chief   coach   and who has taught you magic   You will soon come to know   your end     I will definitely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and will surely crucify you all  
And the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah alone   He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills   And Allah is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
For them is the home of peace and security with their Lord   And He is the One Who is their Protector because of the   pious   deeds which they used to do  
The Day when a friend shall not avail a friend at all   nor will they be helped  
This is of those wisdom   loaded values which your Lord has revealed to you and     O man     do not set up another god with Allah   lest   you should be cast into Hell cursed   and   rejected   from Allahs Mercy    
  It will be said to them   No     this   eternal punishment   is due to the reason that when solely Allah was called upon you used to deny   but when   something   was associated with Him   you used to believe   So   now   the Command is Allahs alone   Who is Most High   Supreme  
And they ascribe a portion of the provisions which We have given them for those   idols   whose   reality   even they themselves do not know   By Allah   you will indeed be asked about what you fabricate  
And warn the people of the Day when the torment will come upon them   Those who will have been doing injustice will say   O our Lord   grant us respite for a while so that we may accept Your message and follow the Messengers     It will be said to them     Are you not those who used to swear before that you would never fall  
So when you and the   people   accompanying you get settled in the Ark then say   All praise be to Allah alone   Who has delivered us from the unjust people  
Surely   worse than   even   all the beasts in the sight of Allah are the people who disbelieve   So they do not come to believe  
The truth is that they alone accept   the invitation of Truth   who listen to it   with truthful hearts     And Allah will raise the dead   the deniers of the truth from the graves as disbelievers     Then   they will be returned to the same   Lord Whom they used to deny    
Surely in the alternation of night and day and in   all   that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth there are   in like manner   Signs for those who live by Godwariness  
And how many communities which were unjust did We destroy and We raised up other communities after them  
And surely We have created above you seven paths   i   e   seven magnetic paths or fields   around the vast atmospheric expanse of the planet earth   for the safeguard of the cosmic system     And We were not unaware of the creation   of the universe and the pre   requisites of its security    
While Allah has created you and   all   your works  
They shall have no food except thorny and dry   venomous herbage  
So that they may show ingratitude towards that   favour of deliverance   which We granted them and enjoy   the unlawful   benefits   of the life of disbelief     But soon they shall know   their fate    
Surely a   Glorious   Messenger from amongst yourselves has come to you   Your suffering and distress   becomes   grievously heavy on him   blessings and peace be upon him       O mankind     he is ardently desirous of your   betterment and guidance   And   he is most   deeply   clement and merciful to the believers  
Allah   as a result of their own choice   has set a seal on their hearts and their ears and there is a blindfold   set   over their eyes   And for them there is severe torment  
And   Musa   Moses     brought out his hand   after putting it under his armpit   and there it became radiant white to the viewers  
Allah has prepared for them Gardens beneath which streams flow   They are their permanent residents   This indeed is a colossal achievement  
Who establish Prayer and pay Zakat   the Alms   due   and it is they who believe in the Hereafter   as well    
Except for Him   Allah     join in to hatch   some   plot against me all of you   including your false gods     then grant me no respite   as well    
And soon shall he be well   pleased   with Allah for His bestowal and Allah with him for his fidelity    
And     O Beloved     if they want to betray you so they have certainly betrayed Allah before this   as well     And     for the same reason   He has placed some of them under   your   authority   And Allah is All   Knowing   Most Wise  
So declare openly all those   matters   that you have been commanded and turn away from those who set up partners with Allah  
And by the One Who will be Present   that Day   and by what will be brought to the Presence  
and that the faith of the believers may further be strengthened   with this confirmation    
Untouched before either by any man or jinn  
And when Musa   Moses   said to his people   O my people   no doubt you have   seriously   wronged your own souls in taking the calf   as your god     Now turn in repentance to your Creator   the True Sustainer    
By the fig and by the olive  
And in crops and palm   trees which have soft and fine blossoms  
O Believers   Make not friends with disbelievers instead of believers   Do you wish to set a manifest evidence for Allah against you   through friendship with the disbelievers    
It will be sparkling white and superbly delicious   a treat for those who drink  
  That News is   not at all   deniable     They will soon know   that reality    
He said   O Lord   then give me respite   to remain alive   till the Day when they are raised alive from the graves  
  They   are those who establish Prayer and spend   in the cause of Allah   out of whatever We have bestowed upon them  
Say   Who can guard and save you from   the punishment of   the Most Kind   Lord   by night and by day   In fact they keep away from the remembrance of the   same   Lord  
So when he neared it   a call was given   Blessed is He Who is   luminously unveiling His veil of Light   in this fire and   also   he who is around it   in the reflection of the theophanies of Allahs Light     And Allah is Holy   and Glorified High above any resemblance and physical manifestation     the Lord of all the worlds  
He   Iblis   said   Grant me respite   to live   till the Day when people will be raised up   from the graves    
Say   The death from which you are fleeing is bound to catch up with you   Then you will be returned to   the Lord   Who knows the unseen and the seen   So He will inform you of what you used to do  
He causes the night to pass into the day and the day to pass into the night   And He has subjected the sun and the moon   to a system     each rotating for an appointed term   Such is Allah your Lord   His is all the Sovereignty   And the idols that you worship apart from Him do not own   even   the thin membrane of a date stone  
Who hinders from good   exceeds the limits   doubts and puts into doubt  
And We will most certainly test you somewhat by means of fear and hunger and certain loss of wealth and lives and fruits   And     O Beloved     give glad tidings to those who observe patience  
  Either   he has invented a lie against Allah or he is insane     Nothing of the sort     The truth is that those who do not believe in the Hereafter are undergoing a torment and are in farthest error  
Nuh   Noah   submitted   O my Lord   help me because they have rejected me  
But he alone   will be the gainer   who appears before the Presence of Allah with a heart protected   from   and pure   of all evils    
Then after this there will come seven hard years   of drought   which will consume that   store   which you will have laid up for these years except a small quantity   which will fall surplus and   which you will keep in reserve  
So when Musa   Moses   came to them with Our clear and enlightening Signs they said   This is nothing but invented magic   we   never   heard of these things among our ancestors  
So go back to them   with your gifts     We will come with such troops   to invade   them they will not have   the power   to fight back   and   humiliating them   we shall drive them out from there in such a plight that they will be dishonoured   becoming prisoners    
Because a blind man approached him   who interrupted his discourse    
We do not make distinction between any of them   in the matter of faith   and we have submitted ourselves to Him alone   the Only   the One God    
And had We so willed   We would have made angels who would have been your successors to replace you in the earth  
And follow the Excellent   Book   that has been revealed to you by your Lord before the torment suddenly comes upon you and you are simply unaware  
Then if he who has undertaken the liability is mentally deficient or physically weak or lacks the ability to dictate the contents   his guardian should dictate with fairness  
This   exceptional   Bounty is from Allah and Allah suffices as a Knower  
And that those who do not believe in the Hereafter   We have prepared for them painful punishment  
O Believers   Obey Allah and obey the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and do not ruin your works  
And   the disbelievers   say   insolently     O man on whom this Quran has been revealed   indeed you are insane  
And there is nothing   obligatory   upon the Godfearing from the account of these   disbelievers     but they   should   admonish them so that they may be protected   from disbelief and mocking the Quran    
The path of those upon whom You have bestowed Your favours  
Do their mental faculties suggest them this   foolishness   or are they rioters and rebels  
And when the Quran is recited   listen to it attentively and observe silence so that mercy may be bestowed upon you  
And when oceans   and rivers   will flood and overflow  
And they say   The Most Kind   Lord   has taken   angels as His   children   Holy is He   Nay     the angels whom they consider His children   are but   Allahs   esteemed servants  
And those who migrated from their   homeland   in the way of Allah   and   were then slain or died   suffering from troubles in the way of Allah     Allah shall indeed provide for them an excellent provision   of bestowals specific to the Last Day     And verily Allah is the Best of providers  
Or He gives them daughters and sons   both   and makes infertile whom He wills   Surely he is All   Knowing   All   Powerful  
So   he who undertakes to perform Hajj   Pilgrimage   during these   months   and makes it obligatory   for himself     then he must neither commit sexual intercourse with the women nor any   other   sin and nor should he quarrel with anyone during Hajj   Pilgrimage   days  
And   intolerant and anguished   man prays   sometimes   for evil as he prays for good   for himself     And man has happened to be very impulsive indeed  
And other   big victories of Makka   Hawazin and Hunain   then Persia and Rome   over which you had no power surely Allah has also encompassed them   for you   and Allah wields Absolute Power over everything  
They exclaimed   We believe in the   real   Sustainer of all the worlds  
These   maidens and other bounties   are for those on the Right Hand  
So   continue to   be patient for the sake of your Lords Command and do not give your ear to any liar   sinner or disbeliever or thankless person from among them  
Or have you become fearless that He may take you back once more   into the sea   and let loose upon you the ship   wrecking tempest and drown you   into the sea   because of your disbelief you used to practise   Then you will not find for yourselves anyone to impeach Us   on this drowning    
And by the even and the odd  
Say   Show me the partners you have associated with Allah   There is no   partner   at all   Truly He is the One Who is Almighty   Most Wise  
Then they blitz   the enemy   at dawn  
Indeed We have created man in the best constitution   equipoised in the finest proportion    
Say   Travel in the land and see how was the end of the evildoers  
So We seized   everyone of   them for his sin   And there was   a faction   of those against whom We sent a storm of pelting stones   And of them was   also a group   whom a roaring blast seized   And   a party   of them were such whom We sank into the earth   And of them there was   yet another community   that We drowned   And Allah would never have wronged them   but they thems
  O idolaters   Think for yourselves     Has your Lord picked you for sons and taken   for Himself   angels as daughters   Indeed you utter a most awful saying   in the framework of your own fabricated ideas    
Are they waiting only for   the torment of   Allah to come in the coverings of clouds   and also the angels   to descend     and the   whole   affair is settled   And to Allah will all matters be returned  
No way   We shall keep writing down what he says   and shall keep increasing for him torment   upon torment    
And as for him who will be given his Record in his left hand will say   Would that I had not been given my Record  
Assuredly   Allah has helped you on a great many occasions and   in particular   on the day of Hunain   when superiority of your   numerical strength   exhilarated you   Then that   numerical superiority   could not prove to you of any avail and the earth   despite its vast expanse   narrowed for you   and then you turned your backs in retreat  
And likewise We raised them up so that they could probe among themselves     So     the vocal one among them said   How long have you stayed   here     They said   We have tarried   here   for a day or   even   a part of that     Winding it up   they   said   Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed   here     So send someone of you to the city with this coin of yours   He sh
And indeed We have made the Quran easy for direction and guidance   but is there anyone who will take advice  
And assuredly he saw Him   Allah Unveiled   the second time   again and you argue only about seeing Him once    
So what has happened to you that you are split into two groups with regard to the hypocrites   while Allah has overturned them   i   e   their reason and contemplation   owing to their misdeeds   Do you seek to guide him to the straight road whom Allah has held strayed   because of their own misdeeds     And     O listener     you cannot at all find a way   of guidance   for him w
There are abundant fruits in it for you to eat  
And by the night when it backs away to depart  
And when they are given advice   they do not accept it  
O Believers   Do not betray the trust of Allah and His Messenger     blessings and peace be upon him   in paying them what is their due     nor betray your mutual trusts while you know   the whole truth    
So if We take you away   from the world     even then We shall take revenge on them  
Surely this Quran expounds to the Children of Israel most of the things in which they differ  
And those   bygone   people used to communicate the messages of Allah   and feared Him   and were afraid of none but Allah   And Allah is Sufficient as a Reckoner  
Till an appointed period   of time    
Surely those who fear their Lord unseen   for them is forgiveness and great reward  
Surely Allah does not give guidance to someone who exceeds limits and is a downright liar  
Tell Me   if We provide them benefit for years  
This is the recompense of your deeds that your hands have forwarded ahead and Allah   indeed   does not do injustice to servants  
Do they have the knowledge of the unseen that they write down   their judgments on the basis of that    
He is the One Who knows the unseen and the visible   Almighty and Ever   Merciful  
It is these people who will be given their reward twice because they remained steadfast and fend off evil with good and they spend in Our Way out of the Bounty We bestowed upon them  
  Implies that   We are hastening   the provision of   good things to them     No way     The truth is that they have no awareness  
And no doubt these people used to say  
And whoever you can influence   destabilize   him   with your voice and invade them with   all the forces at your disposal   mounted and infantry troops   and become a partner with them in their wealth and children and make them   false   promises   And Satan does not make them   any   promises but fraud and deceit  
And he fears   his Lord   as well  
It is prescribed for you that when death approaches someone of you and he leaves some property behind   then he is to make a will for   his   parents and kindred in a reasonable manner   This is imperative for the true believers  
All praise be to Allah alone to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth   and to Him belongs praise in the Hereafter   as well     And He is All   Wise   Well Aware  
So worship Allah for His own sake in sincere obedience and true devotion   even though the disbelievers may despise it  
Except those idolaters with whom you made an agreement   who then did not show any latitude   in executing the treaty   and who did not support   or reinforce   anyone against you   So fulfil the treaty with them till the end of the term   Surely Allah loves those who fear Him  
Not of those who have been afflicted with wrath and nor of those who have gone astray  
O my people   I do not demand of you any recompense for this   promotion and preaching of the message     My reward is   a bountiful obligation   upon Him Who has created me   Do you not apply your mind  
Indeed that   Fire   will be closed upon them all around  
The   torment   that We sent down upon the dividers   i   e   the Jews and the Christians    
And the   idols   whom these   polytheists   worship besides Allah cannot create anything   they have rather been created themselves  
But if it is learnt later that both of them have earned sin   owing to concealing the true witness     then   in their stead   two other   witnesses   should rise from among those whose right the two former   witnesses   have seized     Let them both be closer relatives of the deceased     They should then swear by Allah   Indeed our testimony is truer than the testimony of both o
  O idolaters     Are sons for you and daughters for Him   Allah    
And   remember   Lut   Lot   when he said to his people   Surely you commit the worst indecency   None of the nations in the whole world has ever committed this   indecency   before you  
They   the Jews of Madina and the hypocrites   will not be able to fight against you   even   allied   except in fortified towns or taking cover of walls   They fight hard   but   among themselves   You think they are united whereas their hearts are disunited   The reason is that they do not apply reason  
  And when all were drowned and annihilated except Nuhs   Noahs   Ark   it was commanded   O earth   swallow up your water and   O sky   cease pouring   And the water was dried and the Command was executed and the Ark came to rest on Mount al   Judi and it was said   Far away are the unjust   from Mercy    
The reward of good cannot be anything but good  
Surely those who do not believe in the Revelations of Allah   Allah does not provide them with guidance   i   e   does not also enable them with understanding and insight     And for them is grievous torment  
Those who have rejected the Book   as well as   the Signs with which We sent Our Messengers   they will know   their end   soon  
Allah knows what every female bears in her womb   and how much the wombs contract and how much they distend   and with Him is everything in a fixed measure  
It was said to her   the Queen     Enter the compound of the palace   beneath which were flowing waves of bluish water     So when the Queen saw that   elegant crystal floor   she thought it was a deep pool   And   pulling up her skirt   she uncovered her lower legs   Sulaiman   Solomon   said   This is the compound of the palace paved with crystal slabs   The Queen submitted   O 
Your Lord is well aware of your state of affairs   If He wills   He may have mercy on you or if He likes   He may torment you   And We have not sent you as a guardian over them   to care for all their matters    
  These Near Ones   will be on the thrones ornamented with gold  
  O Beloved     We assuredly know that   what   they say grieves you   So they are not denying you but   in fact   it is the Revelations of Allah that the wrongdoers are denying  
And   also   because of their taking usury   despite that they were forbidden to do it   and because of their usurping others wealth wrongfully   they were punished     And We have prepared a torturous torment for those of them who disbelieve  
And   in story   telling style   narrate to them the example of the people of a city   Antioch   an ancient city in North Syria     when there came to them some Messengers  
He is the One Who made you successors   of former communities   in the earth   So the one who disbelieves   is to face the suffering of disbelief   And the denial of the disbelievers increases for them nothing in the sight of their Lord except His displeasure   And the infidels disbelief adds to them nothing but loss  
And   also recall the time   when We commanded the angels   Prostrate yourselves before Adam   Then they all prostrated themselves to Adam except Iblis   Satan     He refused and showed arrogance and   consequently   became one of the disbelievers  
And surely We gave Musa   Moses   the Book and appointed his brother Harun   Aaron   with him as his minister   for his help    
Surely they found their ancestors misguided  
No doubt this is how We deal with the sinners  
Then by those which bring direction and guidance  
Later   when Isa   Jesus   sensed their disbelief   he said   Who are my helpers in the way of Allah   His sincere companions submitted   We are the helpers of   Din   the religion   of   Allah   We have believed in Allah and bear witness that we are surely Muslims  
And fear the Day when you will be returned to Allah   Then everyone will be paid in full for whatever he has done and they will not be wronged  
Drinking as a thirst   stricken camel drinks  
O Believers   If you help   Din   Religion   of   Allah   He will help you and will make your feet firm  
Indeed the Godfearing will be amid Gardens and fountains  
And shall our forefathers too   be raised

Then even after seeing the signs of   Yusufs   Josephs   decency and righteousness   they deemed it appropriate to imprison him for a time   so that the gossip of the episode among the people might die down    
And from later generations   also   will be a large group   among them    
Then no one of you could have held   Us   back from it  
When he ran towards the full boat  
These are Allahs Verses     O Beloved     We recite them to you with the Truth and indeed you are of the Messengers  
He turned away along with his cabinet members and said     Here is   a magician or a madman  
Surely those who have taken the calf   as a god     the wrath from their Lord will seize them together with humiliation in the life of this world   That is how We punish those who invent falsehood  
And in it We generated for you means of subsistence and also for those   human beings   animals and birds   whom you do not provide for  
And the Essence of your Lord   Who is the Master of Glory and Splendour and the Master of Bounty and Honour will remain  
And every   action   small or big has been written  
So that Day   i   e   the Day of Resurrection   will be an extremely hard day  
So woe to those worshippers  
And whoever believes and does pious acts will have better reward   and We shall   also   say for him in Our Commands what is lenient  
You lay hand on the inherited wealth and devour it   yourselves and do not pay the poverty   stricken their due    
And tell My servants that they should say things that are most balanced   Surely Satan causes contention among people   Indeed Satan is mans declared enemy  
And whatever misfortune befalls you     comes upon you   as a result of that   evil work   which your own hands have done while He forgives most of your   misdoings    
That no one will eat except the sinners  
Say   O People of the Book   you are nowhere   on the path of Din   Religion     until you establish   the system by enforcing   the Torah and the Injil   the Gospel   and whatever has been sent down to you from your Lord   And     O Beloved     the Book which has been sent down to you from your Lord will certainly provoke rebellion and disbelief among most of them   because of je
And by the Lofty Roof   i   e   High Heaven or the Most Exalted Throne    
Then We cast him onto a wide plain   the beach   while he was sick  
And by the night and all that it envelops   under its embrace    
And they say   When will this promise   of torment   be   fulfilled   if you are truthful  
Driven by love for Allah   he spends   his   wealth on the kindred   orphans   the needy   the wayfarers   and those who ask and in   liberating slaves   necks   and establishes Prayer and pays Zakat   the Alms   due    
They will be rewarded with lofty palaces   in Paradise   as recompense for their patience and steadfastness and will be welcomed therein with greetings and salutations of Peace  
And whatever pious acts they do will not be disregarded   and Allah is well aware of those who guard against evil  
And the earth   on the Day of Judgment   will be illumined with the Light of its Lord and the Book   of everyones deeds   will be laid down   And the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought and judgment will be given between the people with truth and justice   And they will not be done any wrong  
  But   the fact is that   the disobedient   man rebels  
And   the disbelievers   say   The Most Kind   Lord   has taken   to Himself   a son  
Then both found   there   one of Our   elite   servants   Khidr   upon whom We had bestowed from Our Presence   special   mercy and had taught him infused knowledge   i   e   the inspired knowledge of secrets and Gnostics    
  They will be   offered to drink   water   from a boiling spring  
And whoever disbelieves     O Esteemed Beloved     let not his disbelief grieve you   They   too   are to return to Us   We shall inform them of the deeds which they used to do   Surely Allah knows best the   hidden   contents of the breasts  
And many faces will be deformed   depressed and dark   that Day  
Have We not made the earth an assembling expanse  
Then the chiefs   and the lords   of his people who disbelieved said   This man is just a human being like you     nothing else     He seeks to establish   his   superiority and predominance over you   And if Allah wanted   to send some Messenger for guidance     He would send down angels   We have never heard of it from our ancestors   that a human being like us should be appoint
Say   O people   surely the Truth has come to you from your Lord   So whoever adopts the path of guidance   adopts it for his own good   and he who is misguided   goes astray for his own destruction   And I am not a custodian over you   that I should bring you to the path of guidance coercively    
And   from Iraq   We rescued Ibrahim   Abraham   and Lut   Lot   his nephew   the son of his brother Haran     towards   Syria     the land in which We have placed blessings for the people of the world  
And   O people   I fear for you a Day of hue and cry   i   e   the Day of Rising    
Never regard those   as the emancipated ones   who rejoice over their crooked works and want to be praised for the deeds that they have never done     Proclaimed for emphasis     never think that they are delivered from punishment   and for them is an awful torment  
And the Day when We shall raise from every people   their Messenger as   a witness   to their deeds     then the disbelievers will not be accorded permission   to put forward any excuse     nor will they be asked   then   to turn to Allah in repentance  
Those whom We gave the Book before this they believe in this   Quran as well in the continuation of the same guidance    
And   when the Jews again rejected the injunctions contained in the Torah     We raised   and suspended the Mount of   Tur over them in order to take a   firm   promise from them   And We commanded them   Enter the gate   of this city   the Ailia gate   prostrating   in gratitude     and We   also   said to them   Do not also violate the Sabbath   prohibition of fishing on Saturda
Allah is He besides Whom there is no God   the Knower of the unseen and the seen   He alone is Most Kind   Ever   Merciful  
And shall our ancestors too   be given life    
Who set up other gods along with Allah   So they will come to know   their end   soon  
So they killed the she   camel   by hamstringing   and rebelled against the command of their Lord and said   O Salih   Bring upon us that   torment   you have threatened us with if you are   truly   from among the Messengers  
Verily I   have come as   a trustworthy Messenger to you  
A curse was set to chase them in this world   and   will chase them   on the Day of Resurrection   as well     Bear in mind that   the people of   Ad denied their Lord   Beware   Far away   from Mercy   are the Ad   the people of Hud  
And surely we ourselves remain engaged in glorifying   Allah    
O People of the Book   Believe in   that Book   which We have revealed   now to Our Beloved Muhammad     blessing and peace be upon him     which   originally   confirms the Book that is with you   before We disfigure   features of some   faces and turn them on to their rear   or cast on them a curse like the one that We cast on those   who disobeyed   in the case of Sabbath   And
Alif   Lam   Mim     Only Allah and the Messenger know the real meaning    
Verily those who believe and persist in pious works and humble themselves before their Lord   it is they who are the people of Paradise   They will live there forever  
The believers   men and women   are helpers and friends to one another   They command good and forbid evil and establish Prayer and pay Zakat   the Alms   due   and obey Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     It is they on whom Allah will soon shower His Mercy   Surely Allah is Almighty   Most Wise  
And one of the two prisoners   who had been released and   now   after a long time remembered   his promise to Yusuf   Joseph       said   I shall tell you its interpretation   so send me   to Yusuf   Joseph      
And it was said to the people   by Pharaohs side     You will assemble together   on this occasion    
Upon your   most illumined   heart so that you may be a Warner   to the disobedient    
On that Day Allah will pay them full recompense that they truly deserve   for their deeds     And they will come to know that Allah is   Himself   the Truth   and also   the Revealer   of the Truth    
  Pray     O my Lord   if You would show me that   torment   which they are being promised  
He created man from a hanging mass   clinging   like a leech   in the mothers womb    
O Messenger   Those   who   advance   fast into disbelief   should not grieve you     Firstly   they include those   hypocrites   who utter from their mouth   We believe   while their hearts have not accepted faith     Secondly   among them are the Jews   They listen to   you   eagerly to fabricate lies   They   in fact   hear   to spy   for others who have not   yet   come to you
Say   to them     What do you think if Allah deprives you of hearing and sight and seals up your hearts     then   who is the god other than Allah who can restore to you these   blessings afresh     Look how diversely We explain Our Revelations   Yet they continue turning away  
And   He also turned towards   those three persons   with Merciful Compassion   whose   decision   was deferred until when the earth   despite all its vastness   closed in upon them and their   own   souls   too   became cumbersome for them   and they knew for sure that there is no refuge from   the torment of   Allah except in   turning towards   Him   Allah then inclined towards
Fighting   for the cause of Allah   has been made incumbent upon you although you are averse to it by temperament   It may be that you dislike a thing and   in fact   that is good for you   And it is   also   likely that you like a thing but   in fact   that is bad for you   And Allah knows well but you do not know  
Submit   O Allah   Originator of the heavens and the earth   Knower of the unseen and the seen   You alone will judge between Your servants those   matters   in which they used to disagree  
The Day when the Trumpet will be blown   you will flock   in the Holy Presence of Allah   in droves  
We too shall soon call   Our   guards   the angels appointed to inflict the punishment of Hell    
But when they forgot that Reminder which was urged upon them We opened up for them the gates   to abundance   of everything   to take them to their end   until when they luxuriated   in ecstasy of sensual delights and sensuous gratification   with all that was provided for them We seized them all of a sudden   with torment   and they were struck with despair  
And those who have disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups until   when they approach it   Hell     its gates will be opened and its keepers will say to them   Did Messengers not come to you from among yourselves who recited to you the Verses of your Lord and warned you of this Days appearance   They   the inmates of Hell   will say   Yes     they came     But the command of 
Or   lest   you should say   Had the Book been sent down to us we would certainly have been better guided than they are   So   now has come to you from your Lord the clear proof and guidance and mercy   Then who can be more unjust than he who treats the Revelations of Allah as lies and evades them   Soon shall We inflict an evil torment upon those who evade Our Revelations because
So We sent among them   also   a Messenger from among themselves   Worship Allah   There is no God for you other than He   So do you not fear  
And whoever seeks a Din   Religion   other than Islam that shall not at all be accepted from him   and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter  
With eyes cast down   they will come out of their graves like scattered locusts  
And We brought the Children of Israel across the   Mediterranean   Sea where they came upon a people who were squatting around their idols   for worship   in deep devotion   They   the Children of Israel   said   O Musa   Moses     Make for us too a god like the ones they have   Musa   Moses   said   You are surely a very ignorant people  
By the heavenly universe which will regress to its primitive state  
Assuredly   the people who disbelieve after accepting belief and then advance in disbelief   their repentance will not be accepted at all   and it is they who have lost the right path  
And adopt moderation while walking and keep your voice low   Surely the worst voice is the bray of a donkey  
When they sat beside it  
And by that Being Who created male and female   in everything    
Until when these   troops   reached an open field of ants   one ant said   O ants   enter your dwellings   lest Sulaiman   Solomon   and his troops crush you while they remain just unaware  
And had Allah so willed   He would have made all of them a single community   But He admits to His Mercy whom He likes   And for the wrongdoers there will be no protector or guardian  
Allah increases sustenance for whom He pleases of His servants and restrains for whom He wills   Surely Allah knows everything full well  
They are shut in humiliation wherever they may be found   except that they are   provided with shelter   under some promise with Allah or some bond with people   And they have earned Allahs wrath   and have been subjected to indigence consequent on their rejection of Allahs Revelations and killing the Prophets unjustly   because they turned into rebels and exceeded all limits   in
A sacred month is the requital of a sacred month and   other   sacred things also requite one another   So if someone wrongs you   you may also wrong him but proportional to his offense   And fear Allah   And remember that Allah is with those who fear Him  
Those who become most humble and submissive in their Prayer  
And even if I resolve to counsel you   my counsel   too   will not benefit you if Allah wills to lead you astray   He is your Lord and you will be returned to Him alone  
And never perform   funeral   Prayer over any of these   hypocrites   who dies   nor stand at his grave   because your stepping on some place also brings about mercy and blessings   and they do not deserve your mercy and blessing     Indeed they disbelieved Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and died as defiant  
These are the limits   set   by Allah   So   do not exceed them   And those who exceed the limits prescribed by Allah   it is they who are the wrongdoers  
And those who have fabricated a lie against Allah you will see them on the Day of Resurrection that their faces are turned black   Is the abode of the arrogant not in Hell  
  In the beginning   all the people agreed upon the same Din   Religion   Later   when differences emerged among them     Allah sent His Messengers as Bearers of good news and Warners and sent down with them the Book based on Truth   so that it might judge those matters among the people in which they had developed differences  
And weigh with a straight balance  
Does man think We will not at all collect his bones   which will decompose into dust particles after his death    
That which is left over from Allahs provision   only that   is better for you if you have faith   And I am not a guardian over you  
Does he think that no one can ever overpower him  
  O Beloved     These are news of the Unseen which We reveal to you   But   at that time   you were not present with them when they were casting their pens   by way of a draw to determine   which of them should take care of Maryam   Mary     Nor were you with them when they were disputing with one another  
Verily   We have made it the Quran in the Arabic   language   so that you may understand  
And when they   the hypocrites   meet the believers   they say   We   too   have believed   and when they meet their devils in privacy they assure them   We are certainly with you   We only mock   the believers    
Yes   of course   We have also the power to restore and set right even his finger joints   phalanges   and finger tips  
Indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day there are Signs   of Allahs Absolute Authority   for those who possess constructive wisdom  
And He   is the One Who   has subjected to your service the night and the day and the sun and the moon   and all the stars have also been made subservient to   the system according to   His strategy   Surely there are Signs in it for those who possess reason  
Then he frowned and twisted his face  
And remember the Name of your Lord morning and evening  
And when Our clear Verses are recited to them   then   the disbelievers say about the Truth   the Quran   while it has come to them   This is obvious magic  
And whoever fears standing before his Lord   for Meeting     for him are two Gardens  
  This   is the Promise of Allah   Allah does not go against His promise but most people do not know  
Wherein they will live forever  
  These men of Truth   are those who   if We establish their rule in the earth   will establish   systems of   Prayer     organize and control   paying of Zakat   the Alms   due     enjoin righteousness   and piousness in the whole society   and forbid   people from   evil   And the result of all the endeavours is in the control of Allah  
And so that Allah may grant you most honourable help and support  
Has the time not   yet   come for the believers that their hearts get humbled with tenderness for the remembrance of Allah   and for that Truth   as well   which has been sent down   and that they do not become like those who were given the Book before this   then a long time passed over them and their hearts hardened   And many of them are disobedient  
And if you die or be slain   you   all   will be brought together before Allah  
           Qaf     Only Allah and the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   know the real meaning     By the Glorious Quran  
  O Beloved     He is the One Who has revealed to you   this   Book with Truth     It   confirms   all those Books   that were revealed before it   And He is the One Who has revealed the Torah and the Injil   the Gospel    
Do those who have earned evil deeds think that We will make them resemble those who believe and do good deeds   so as   to make their life and death alike   The claim   which they   the disbelievers   make   is the worst evil  
Allah erases whatever   writing   He wills and confirms   whatever He wills     And with Him alone is the Real Book   the Protected Tablet   al   Lawh al   Mahfuz      
Indeed this   Quran   is a Reminder   So whoever desires may adopt the way to   reach   his Lord  
And your Lord creates whatever He wills and chooses   whom He pleases for Prophethood and for the right of intercession     These   disbelievers and polytheists   have no authority or choice   in this matter     Holy is Allah the Glorious and Exalted far above   the false gods   that they associate as partners   with Allah    
And if you fear a breach between the two then appoint one arbitrator from the husbands family and the other from the wifes family   If both   the arbitrators   resolve to bring about settlement   Allah will create harmony between them   Indeed   Allah is All   Knowing   All   Aware  
And   also recall   when the disciples said   Isa son of Maryam   Jesus son of Mary     is it possible for your Lord to send down to us from heaven a table   spread with food     Isa   Jesus   said   in reply       O people     fear Allah if you are illumined with faith  
And He is the One Who gives life and causes death and in His control is   also   the alternation of night and day   So do you not understand  
And spread there great mischief and corruption  
Musa   Moses   said   to the sorcerers     Woe to you     Beware     Do not invent a lie against Allah lest He should eliminate you by torment   And surely he who fabricates a lie   against Allah   is a failure  
  The Lord   of Mighty Powers   directly   conferred on him   perfect   knowledge  
They said   Put   the matter   of Musa   Moses   and his brother off   for a while   and send out heralds to   different   cities to summon   magicians    
And   then   you committed that deed which you committed   i   e   you killed a Coptic     and you are one of the ungrateful   you have forgotten our guardianship and favours    
Alif   Lam   Mim     Only Allah and the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   know the real meaning    
When they came inside to Dawud   David     he felt nervous   They said   Do not feel upset   We are two parties in a dispute   One of us has wronged the other   So judge between us with truth and justice   and do not exceed limits   and lead us towards the right path  
Have you seen him who has taken the desire of his lower self as god   Would you then become a guardian over him  
And their   so   called   Prayer at the House of Allah   Kaba   is nothing more than whistling and clapping hands   So taste the torment because you used to disbelieve  
And that Day the sky will be rent asunder   changed into   the resemblance of smoke   like   a cloud   and the angels will be sent down ranks upon ranks  
They know   all   those   actions   which you do  
And no one will be able to bind as He binds  
They   also   belied both of them   So they too became of those who were eliminated  
Verily those who turn away from the straight path with regard to   the meanings of   Our Verses are not hidden from Us   Then   is he better who is thrown into the Fire of Hell or someone who comes safe and secure   from the torment   on the Day of Resurrection   Do as you wish   Surely He sees all that you do  
And whoever remains blind   to the Truth   in this   world   will be blind in the Hereafter as well   distracted from the path   of deliverance    
This is not a Messengers glory that he should have   disbelievers as   prisoners of war   until he has let much of the blood of these   mischief   monger terrorist militants   in the land   You   people   desire the riches of the world   and Allah intends   prosperity in   the Hereafter and Allah is Almighty   Most Wise  
And when the layers of heaven will be torn asunder and moved away from their places  
So the punishments that came upon them were due to the acts that they had perpetrated   and the same   chastisement   they used to make fun of engulfed them  
Has he not been given the knowledge of   matters   mentioned in the scriptures of Musa   Moses    
This   torment too   is on the pattern of the people of Pharaoh and those who preceded them   they   also   denied the Signs of their Lord   So   We destroyed them due to their sins and We drowned the people of Pharaoh   in the river     And they all were oppressors  
And all Greatness   i   e   Eminence   in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him alone and He is the One Who is Almighty   Most Wise  
And indeed when the disbelievers listen to the Quran it seems as if they wish to damage you with their   jealously evil   looks and say   He is insane  
So I swear by the Lord of the easts and the wests that surely We have Absolute Power  
Most Blessed is He   If He pleases He can produce gardens for you   far   better than these   here in the world   beneath which streams flow   and raise for you magnificent palaces   but these are not the conditions for a Prophet and Messenger    
Ibrahim   Abraham   said     All right     peace be on you   I shall beg forgiveness for you from my Lord   even   now   He is indeed very kind to me     He may bestow guidance upon you    
Or do they say   He   the Messenger   has invented it   the Quran   himself     No indeed     rather they simply do not believe   in the Truth    
So Pharaoh disobeyed that Messenger and We seized him with a devastating seizure  
So they defeated them   the army of Jalut   Goliath     by Allahs Command and Dawud   David   killed Jalut   And Allah granted   Dawud   sovereignty and wisdom and taught him what He wished   If Allah had not removed one group by means of another     the human life on   earth would have been ruined   due to persistent suppression and oppression by tyrants     But Allah is Bountifu
And say   The Truth has come and falsehood has fled   Surely falsehood has to perish  
Whoever strives hard   for the cause of Truth   strives for his own   benefit     Surely Allah is independent of   the obedience   submission   toils and struggles   of all the worlds  
For any of you who seeks to advance forward   in piety   or who lags behind   trapped in evil    
And He sent on to them   ambient   swarms of birds  
When Salih   their   kinship   brother   said to them   Do you not fear   Allah    
And Nuh   Noah   called out to his Lord and submitted   O my Lord   indeed my son   too   was a part of my family and certainly Your promise is true   and You are the Greatest of all rulers  
Do they not see that they are put in trouble once or twice every year     Even   then they do not repent   nor do they take advice  
And   call to mind   when your Lord said to the angels   I am about to place My deputy on the earth   They submitted   Will You put as Your   vicegerent   on the earth such as will do mischief in it and shed blood   while we are engaged in glorifying You with celebrating Your Praise and extolling Your Holiness   all the time       Allah   said   I know that which you do not know  
And affirms good   Din   Religion     of Truth and life after death through charity and Godwariness    
Those who divided the Quran into pieces   and split it i   e   accepted the favourable verses but rejected the others    
Until when they reach Hell   their ears   their eyes and their skins will bear witness against them concerning the works that they use to do  
They hide   their deceitfulness   from people   feeling ashamed     but feel no shame before Allah while He is with them when they hold consultations   secretly   at night about that matter which Allah disapproves   And Allah has encompassed whatever they do  
Rather he kept belying and turning away  
And when Our Revelations are recited to such a one   he turns his face away showing arrogance as though he had not heard it at all   as if there were weight   of deafness   in his ears   So give him the news of an agonizing torment  
Except that old woman who was of those who stayed behind  
  Musa   Moses     said   Even if I bring you something manifest   also as a miracle    
Then We sank him   Qarun   Korah     and his house into the earth   So except Allah there was no   such   party that could help him   in saving from the torment     Nor could he stop the torment himself  
Then   when it was caught into a whirlpool   they cast lots and   in the draws   he came to be the loser   i   e   his name was drawn and those in the boat threw him into the river    
To show ingratitude for the Bounty which We have given them   So enjoy benefits   of a few days life     then soon you will know   your end    
And We appointed for them companions   Satans     So they made   all those deeds   fascinating to them which were in their front and in their rear   And the same command of torment proved true against them that had gone forth against the communities of jinn and mankind that had passed before them   Surely they were the losers  
And that is because Allah alone is the Truth   and whatever they   i   e   the disbelievers   worship besides Him is certainly falsehood and verily Allah is Most High   Most Great  
And We gave both of them the clear and enlightening Book   the Torah    
Well   did they not see   even this much   that this   calf   could not answer them a word   nor had it any power to cause them any loss or profit  
Iblis said   O Lord   because You have led me astray   I will   also   best adorn and embellish for them   the sins   revolts and violations   in the earth and will certainly lead all of them astray by all means  
Then He will return you into the same   earth   and will then bring you forth   from the same again    
And you will see them brought to Hell with their heads bent with disgrace and fear   looking at it covertly   with stealthy glance   and the believers will say   Surely the losers are those who put their own souls and their families into loss on the Last Day   Remember   Indeed the wrongdoers will remain in   the agony of   a lasting torment  
They turned towards them and said   What have you found missing  
Both of them submitted   O our Lord   we fear lest he should commit some excess against us or become   more   rebellious  
For them there are   everlasting   Gardens with streams flowing under their   palaces     They will be adorned with bracelets of gold in these Gardens   and they will wear green attires of fine brocade and heavy silk   And there they will recline upon raised and richly adorned thrones   What an excellent reward and how beautiful a resting place

  Finding these blessings and bounties     they will pray in these   Gardens     Holy You are   O Allah   and the word of their mutual greetings will be   Peace     Or the word for their reception from Allah and the angels will be   Peace     And their supplication will end   with these words     All praise belongs to Allah   the Lord of all the worlds  
And   all   the unseen of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah alone and He is the One towards Whom every act is returned   So keep worshipping Him and keep trust in Him alone   And your Lord is not unmindful of the deeds that all of you do  
  O Beloved     Have you not seen him who began to dispute with Ibrahim   Abraham   about his own Lord because Allah had given him kingdom   When Ibrahim   Abraham   said   My Lord is He Who gives life and   also   causes death     the king   said   in reply     I   too   give life and cause death   Ibrahim   Abraham   said   Surely   Allah causes the sun to rise in the east   bri
Except those of Your servants who are chosen and exalted ones  
Indeed those who maintain rivalry against Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   will be humiliated as those before them were humiliated   And surely We have sent down clear Revelations and there is humiliating torment for the disbelievers  
He raised high all the heavenly spheres   planets   after creating them in the infinite cosmos     then moderated   equipoised and stabilized   their composition   construction   functions and movements    
And Nuh   Noah   set himself to building the Ark   And whenever the chiefs of his people passed by him   they would scoff at him   Nuh   Noah   would say   in reply     If you are mocking us   today     we shall also mock you   tomorrow   as you are mocking us  
Have they not seen   i   e   pondered   how Allah originates creation   then repeats it   the same way     Surely this   work   is easy for Allah  
And the Day when He will gather all together   then He will say to the angels   Is it they who used to worship you  
And silken cushions orderly lined up  
  They   are the ones who spy to coin lies     Moreover     they voraciously devour unlawful wealth and property   If they approach you   with a dispute for judgment   then it is   up to   you whether to judge between them or decline   And if you opt to keep away from them   even then   they are incapable of doing you any harm but if you judge   then judge between them   too but  
And when   such   a Sura   chapter   is revealed   Believe in Allah and fight in the cause of Allah along with His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     the affluent and the influential amongst them seek leave from you and say   Leave us   We shall remain with those who sit   behind    
O mankind   An example is given   so listen to it attentively   Verily the   idols   you worship besides Allah cannot create   even   a fly though they all may join in for this   purpose     And if the fly snatches a thing away from them   they cannot   even   recover it from that   fly     How helpless is the seeker   worshipper   and the sought   god    
And proclaim   well   the bounties of your Lord  
Pharaoh said     Have   you believed in Him even before I permitted you   This is indeed a plot which you   all   have hatched   against me   in this city in order that you may expatriate from this   country   its   Coptic   inhabitants   So you will know   its consequences   very soon  
But as for those who disobeyed   their abode is Hell   Every time they will intend to get out of it and escape   they will be turned back into it and it will be said to them   Keep enjoying the taste of this Fire of Hell which you used to belie  
And surely We sent Nuh   Noah   to his people   He said   O people   always worship Allah   There is no God for you other than He   So do you not fear  
So pray to your Lord and offer sacrifice   a token of gratitude    
Say   If you were the owners of the treasures of my Lords Mercy   you would even then hold   your hands   back   from spending   for fear of   total   exhaustion   And man has turned out to be highly narrow   minded and niggardly  
From your Lord this is the reward which is an   amply   sufficient bestowal   in proportion to your works    
Allah admonishes you never ever to repeat such a thing   in your lifetime     if you are believers  
And observe patience for the sake of your Lord  
These   the hypocrites   wish that you should also disbelieve as they have disbelieved so that you all might become alike   So do not make friends with   any of   them until they emigrate in the Way of Allah   in order to prove their faith and truthfulness     Then   if they turn away   seize them and kill them wherever you find them   and take not   any of   them either for a fri
And when Our enlightening Revelations are recited to them   those who do not believe in meeting Us say   Bring us a Quran different from this one or alter it     O Glorious Messenger     say   I have no right to modify it of my own accord   I follow only   that   which is revealed to me   I indeed fear the chastisement of the Mighty Day if I go against my Lord  
And Thamud and the people of Lut   Lot   and the dwellers of   the Wood   al   Aika   i   e   the people of Shuaib   too   denied     These were the large armies  
  O Beloved   say from My side     O My servants   you who have believed   adopt Godwariness   it is for these men of spiritual excellence in this world that there is excellent reward   And Allahs earth is vast   So the steadfast will certainly be given their reward without measure  
This practice of Allah has   continued   through generations that have passed before   and you will never find any amendment in the way practised by Allah  
  And He said to you     Eat of the pure things that We have provided for you and do not exceed limits in that   or My wrath will become inevitable for you   And he on whom My wrath comes due is in truth destroyed  
The Sovereignty of all the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah alone and Allah has Perfect Control over everything     So focus your attention on and trust in Him alone    
No way   He has certainly been inimical to Our Revelations  
Say     Both   the pure and the impure can never be alike     O listener     even though the abundance of the polluted and foul   objects   may fascinate you   So     instead of monitoring the difference of abundance and scarcity   fear Allah   O men of wisdom   so that you may flourish and prosper  
This will only be a Mighty Blast   Then all of them will be brought to Our Presence straight away  
And had We so willed We would have exalted him by means of   knowledge and implementation of   these   Revelations     but he   himself   tracked down to   the lowest levels of the   earthly life and became the follower of his lust     Now   his example is that of a dog   If you treat him harshly   he will loll out his tongue or if you leave him alone   he will   still   loll out 
What has happened to you   Muslims     that you do not fight in the cause of Allah   for the freedom of the oppressed   whereas those helpless   oppressed and tyrannized   men   women and children who     depressed by the oppression and tyranny     call out   for their freedom     O our Lord   Rescue us from this town whose   affluent and influential   people are oppressors and ap
Nay   We provided for them and their fathers   generous luxuries   so much so that their life spans also gradually prolonged   So do they not perceive that   through Islamic conquests   We are gradually reducing the land   under their control   from all borders   So   will they dominate   now    
And We   have   made the day   a time   for   earning   livelihood  
Of course he who adopts evil and is encompassed by his sins   it is they who are the inmates of Hell   They are its permanent residents  
O Believers   If you obey any section of the People of the Book   they will turn you back to disbelief after you have   embraced   faith  
Indeed We are going to send a she   camel for them to test them   So     O Salih     wait for their   end   and continue observing patience  
I communicate to you the messages of my Lord and exhort you   and I know from Allah that which you do not know  
And when the example of   Isa   Jesus     son of Maryam   Mary   is given   your people   mockingly   laugh  
Thamud and Ad rejected the   calamity of a   Shattering Gravitational Collision   of all the existent cosmic bodies    
They who do not put   any   belief in it seek to hasten this   Hour     and those who believe fear it and know that its coming is the truth   Beware   Those who argue about the Hour are in extreme error  
On the Day when every soul shall find present   before him   every good that he accomplished and every evil that he perpetrated   he will wish there were a great distance between him and that evil   or that Day     Allah warns you to fear   the wrath   of His Divine Essence and Allah is Most Compassionate towards His servants  
And at night as well   Do you not even then understand  
And if We will We can surely show these   hypocrites   to you   in such a manner   that you may recognize them by their facial expressions and   likewise   you may recognize them by their conversation style and Allah knows   best   all your actions  
Assuredly   when the earth will be cleft asunder and crushed to dust particles  
  What help can they provide     For   in truth   they will be standing bending their necks Today  
And this   Revelation has also come to me   that if they had remained firm on the right path   the path of Truth   the path of the remembrance of Allah     then We would have provided them with abundant water  
There is nothing   like life after death     Our life is only this world   We live and die   here alone   and   that is all     We shall not be raised up   again    
Thus have We forced its   denial   firmly into the hearts of the sinners  
It may be that Allah brings about friendship   at a later stage   between you and those of them who are now your foes   And Allah is All   Powerful and Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
And those that produce sparks striking their hoofs on rocks  
O Believers   Avoid most conjectures   Indeed some conjectures are sins   liable to punishment in the Hereafter     And spy not   on someones unknown matters or secrets     nor backbite one another   Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother   You would hate it   And fear Allah   in all such matters     Indeed Allah is Ever   Returning   Ever   Merciful  
The curse has been made to chase them in this world and   this will chase them   on the Day of Resurrection   as well     What an evil gift has been bestowed upon them  
So which of your Lords blessings will you both deny  
And say   Do work   Allah as well as His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and the believers   too   will soon see your work   And you will shortly be returned to   the Lord   Who knows everything veiled and unveiled   So He will inform you of the works that you used to do  
  Those   are evergreen gardens beneath which streams flow     They   will dwell therein forever   And that is the reward for the one who purifies himself   of the impurity and indecency of disbelief and immorality    
And whoever is in the heavens and the earth prostrates himself before Allah     some   willingly and   others   perforce   and their shadows   too prostrate themselves before Him   morning and evening     Then why do the disbelievers do idol   worship turning away from Allah    
And   second   those on the Left Hand     in what miserable plight will be   the Left Hand party  
And We delivered them and their people from the ordeal  
And when you lay hand on someone you do it like ruthless tyrants  
And We rained on them   stones     So how devastating was that rain on the people who were stressed with horror  
I swear by the Day of Resurrection  
When We abrogate some verse or cause it to be forgotten     in either case   We bring   some other verse   better than or similar to it   Do you not know that Allah has   Absolute   Control over everything  
Who are possessors of eminence   and   embodiments of obedience  
It is a Bounty of your Lord   i   e   your Lord will bestow through your mediation alone     That is but a great success  
Then return after going to that very place from where   the other   people return   And beg from Allah forgiveness   earnestly     Allah is   of course   Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
  Seeing the signs of torment     they believed   So We granted them prosperity for a time  
But   it   is   revealed as   admonition for him who fears   his Lord    
And it is not possible that the people of the town whom We destroyed will not return to Us   after death    
Polite conversation   with the needy   and extending tolerance are far better than charity followed by injuring   his   heart   And Allah is Self   Sufficient   Forbearing  
And whoever commits sin is only bringing   its consequent misery   to his own soul and Allah is All   Knowing   Most Wise  
Dawud   David   said   He has done you a wrong in demanding your ewe to add to his own ewes   and it is true that most of the partners wrong one another except those who believe and do pious deeds   and such people are very few   And it occurred to Dawud   David   that We had put him to trial   through that dispute     So he prayed for forgiveness from his Lord and fell down prost
But these are the clear verses   of the Quran   that are   preserved   in the breasts of those who have been given   true   knowledge   And none other than the unjust deny Our Revelations  
Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days   i   e   six phases     He then settled Himself on the Throne   the Command and Control System of universe   befitting His Glory     You have no helper or intercessor apart from Him   So do you not accept direction and guidance  
  He was   greatly righteous   and dutiful   to his parents and was neither disobedient nor arrogant   like common boys    
  Allah said     Then set out with My servants by night   You shall certainly be chased  
Nor shall you   ever   worship   the Lord   Whom I worship  
Why should Allah torment you if you become grateful and believe   And Allah is Most Appreciative   of every truth     Well Aware   of every act    
There are benefits for you in these   sacrificial animals   for a fixed term   Then they are to arrive at the Ancient House   the Kaba for sacrifice    
  O My Esteemed Beloved     because you are residing in it  
And     O Jews     certainly you know well those of you who violated   the injunctions concerning   the Sabbath   Saturday     So We said to them   Be you apes   rejected and despised  
If   even then   they belie you     My Beloved   do not be aggrieved     So many Messengers were belied before you who brought clear Signs   miracles     Scriptures and the Enlightening Book  
From the evil influence   and harmfulness   of everything that He has created  
There is no God but He   He is the One Who gives life and causes death   He is your Lord and the Lord of your fathers   as well    
And the disbelievers say   When we are lost in the earth   shall we then be created anew   In fact they deny the meeting with their Lord  
And to Him belongs   all the creation   that reposes at night and during the day   And He is All   Hearing   All   Knowing  
And indeed there came to them from among themselves a Messenger but they denied him   So the torment seized them and they were certainly the wrongdoers  
But   if they disobey you   then say   I am disgusted by these   evil   deeds which you are doing  
And those who have taken idols instead of Allah as their protectors and guardians   Allah is Ever   Watchful over their   affairs     And you are not responsible for them   the disbelievers    
And those who refrain from major sins and the indecencies   and when they feel furious   they forgive  
But whoever repents and believes and does pious deeds will surely be of those who are successful  
My power and domain have   also   gone from me  
Then by means of this We caused to grow for you   step by step firstly herbs   then plants and then trees and   the gardens of dates and grapes     Furthermore   We created   for you many   other   fruits of which you eat   now    
And on that Day the weighing   of deeds   is a truth   So those whose scales   of righteous deeds   are heavy will be successful  
And as for the boy   his parents were blessed with faith   So we feared that   if he lived on he would become a disbeliever   and on attaining to maturity   he would afflict both of them with disobedience and disbelief  
And he   the glorious Messenger   is not at all miserly in   disclosing   the Unseen     The Lord of the Throne has not left for him any deficiency    
Indeed these   episodes   contain lessons of warning for him who fears the chastisement of the Last Day   This   Day of Rising   is the Day when entire mankind will be gathered together and it is this Day when all will be made present  
Then he who alters this   will   after hearing it   its sin will be on those who alter it   Allah is indeed All   Hearing   All   Knowing  
And   also   of His Signs is that He created for you mates of your own kind so that you acquire peace from them   and He created between you love and mercy   Verily in this   system of creation   there are Signs for those who meditate  
That Allah may reward the Truthful for their truth and may torment the hypocrites if He wills or may accept their repentance   Surely Allah is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
And when it is said to them   Come so that Allahs Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   may seek forgiveness for you   these   hypocrites   jerk their heads aside   insolently   and you see them keeping away   from your presence   in arrogance  
We said   to Musa   Moses       Do not fear   Verily   you will have the upper hand  
They are the ones who spend in the cause of Allah whether they are affluent or indigent   in both the conditions     sublimate their anger and tolerate   the faults of the   people   and Allah loves those who are benevolent  
One of them wise and inclined to the balanced judgment said   Did I not say to you   why do you not glorify and remember Allah  
And We have also appointed stages   of motion and rotation   of the moon till   its appearance to the dwellers of the earth wanes to   the semblance of an old dry branch of a palm   tree  
So give them the news of a painful punishment  
The Messiah feels no embarrassment in being a servant of Allah   Nor do the closest angels   ever feel ashamed     And whoever disdains to be His servant and perpetrates arrogance   He will soon assemble together all such people before Him  
And surely We have created a large   number   of jinn and human beings for Hell   They have hearts   and minds but   cannot understand   the Truth   with them   and they have eyes   but   cannot perceive   the Truth   with them   and   also   they possess ears   but   cannot hear   the Truth   with them   They are like cattle   rather more misguided   than that     It is they who 
And will fill your stomachs with it  
And like this   Ark   We made for them   many other means of transport   which they ride  
Shuaib said   O my people   tell me if I adhere to the clear proof from my Lord and He has also granted me pure and fine means of living from His Presence     then why should I not preach the Truth     I   also   do not want that   following you   I myself start doing   against the Truth   the same that I am forbidding you   All I desire is to   reform   you as far as I can   and 
And by the Promised Day  
He is the One Who makes the night pass into the day and the day pass into the night   And He is also Well Aware of the   hidden   contents of the hearts  
The scriptures of Ibrahim   Abraham   and Musa   Moses    
Say   That   Day of Rising   is the tremendous piece of news  
Then We made those We chose from among Our servants   i   e   the Muslim Umma   Community     the inheritors of the Book   the Quran     So of them are those who wrong their own souls   and of them are also those who are moderate following the middle course   and of them are still those who excel in doing pious deeds by Allahs Command   This   excelling and becoming perfect   is b
He alone has created the heavens and the earth with a zero   defect strategy   He is exalted far above those objects which the disbelievers set up as   His   peers  
Their reward is the Gardens of eternal living in the Presence of their Lord   with streams flowing under them   They shall live in them forever   Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him   This   status   is meant for the one who fears his Lord  
They said   O Salih   only you have been the centre of hopes among our people before this   Are you forbidding us to worship those   idols   which our forefathers used to worship   We are really caught in a disquieting doubt about   the Oneness of Allah   towards which you are calling us  
And We bestowed upon them   also   Our Signs but they persisted in turning away from them  
And indeed We bestowed upon Dawud   David   and Sulaiman     Solomon   extraordinary knowledge   and both said   All praise be to Allah Who has exalted us above many of His believing servants  
And let no harm be done to either the scribe or the witness   but if you do so   it will be sheer disobedience on your part  
Say   I look like you only   by virtue of my visible creation   as a man     Otherwise just think what congruity you have with me     It is I to whom the Revelation is transmitted that your God is the One and only God     And just see to it whether you have any such divine potential that the Word of Allah may come down to you     So   whoever hopes to meet his Lord should do good 
Would that they knew   the truth of   this   bargain    
Allah has promised the believers   men and women   Gardens with streams flowing beneath   They will dwell therein forever   And   He has also promised   such blessed mansions as are located at a special site in Paradise amidst evergreen Gardens   and   then   the greatest   bliss of all   is the Pleasure and Acceptance of Allah   which will be awarded as a mighty compensation     
But they rejected the Messenger and hamstrung   the she   camel     So because of their sin their Lord sent down destruction on them and levelled   them all in the torment devastating   the town  
So We delivered him   Lut   Lot     and his family except his wife   she was one of those who stay on in torment  
Is it amazing for the people that We sent down Revelation to a   perfect   man from among themselves   Warn   the disoriented and distracted   people   of Allahs torment   and give glad tidings to the believers that there is high rank   i   e   exalted status   for them in the Presence of their Lord     The disbelievers said   Indeed this person is an evident magician  
Then what is the matter with these   disbelievers that even then   they turn away from the Reminder  
So turn your face away from them and wait and they   too   are waiting  
And when We bestowed upon Musa   Moses   the Book and the miracle distinguishing the truth from falsehood so that you might take the path of guidance  
Surely that will be your reward and your hard work is acknowledged  
This is verily true and established that Allah knows all that they hide and all that they show   Surely He does not like the defiers and arrogant  
So on that Day woe to those who belie  
And early in the morning they left     feeling   quite competent to execute their plan   of getting the yield and depriving the poor of their share    
These   deniers of the Truth   desire to put out the Light of Allah by   blowing   with their mouths whereas Allah will take His Light to perfection   even though the disbelievers may dislike it intensely  
And if We sent down to them angels   and the dead started talking to them   and We gathered everything in clusters   before their eyes     even then they would not believe except what Allah willed   and most of them put ignorance to work  
Say   Surely my Lord releases sustenance in abundance for whom He wills and restrains for whom   He likes     And whatever you spend   in the way of Allah     He will increase it with more in recompense   And He is the Best Sustainer  
And for you indeed there are   also   aspects to the cattle that need contemplation   We make you drink   milk We prepare from some ingredients   of what is in their bellies   And there are for you   also   many   other   benefits in them   and you eat   some   of them   as well    
And surely We graciously favoured you once   earlier as well    
And those who believe and their children follow them in faith   We shall unite their children also with them   in the ranks of Paradise even if their actions would not fall in that grade   It would be in the honour of their pious fathers     And We will also not reduce anyway the reward of the actions of their   pious fathers   Besides this     everyone will be held in   reward an
They will say   O our Lord   You have caused us to die twice and You have   also   given us life twice     Now   we confess our sins   So is there any way out   to escape from this chastisement    
And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     they are the people who shall be in the company of those   spiritual dignitaries on the Last Day   whom Allah has blessed with His   special   favour   the Prophets   the Truthful   the Martyrs and the Most Pious   And how excellent these companions are  
He submitted   O my Lord   forgive me and bestow on me such a reign that no one may have after me   Surely You are Most Benevolent  
  This affirmation contains no truth     In fact whatever they used to hide before   all that   has become visible to them   And   even   if they were sent back   to the world   they would   once again   do the same that they had been forbidden   And undoubtedly they are   seasoned   liars  
  And the angels say     Everyone of us has an appointed station  
And those   who are committed to sacrifice and   in whose wealth there is a fixed share  
Have you not seen that vessels sail on the sea by Allahs Bounty so that He shows you some of His Signs   Surely there are Signs in it for every greatly steadfast and grateful person  
O People of the Book   Indeed there has come to you Our Messenger who unfolds to you   clearly   many such things from the Book as you have been concealing and who overlooks many of   your   wrongs   too     There has indeed come to you a light from Allah   i   e   Muhammad   blessings and peace be upon him     and an Enlightening Book   i   e   the Holy Quran    
But those who repent   make amends   and establish a firm bond with Allah   and make their Din   faith and devotion   sincerely for Allah will be in the company of the believers   And Allah will soon bestow a tremendous reward upon the believers  
Or He may seize them during their movements   travelling and business trips     So   they cannot hinder Allah  
  Allah said     Strike the ground with your foot   Here is a spring   of cool water   to bathe and drink  
If you lend a good loan to Allah   with sincerity and righteous intention     He will increase it manifold for you and will forgive you   And Allah is Most Appreciative   Most Forbearing  
Sulaiman   Solomon   said   O courtiers   which of you can bring me the throne   of the Queen   before they come to me in submission  
Surely you and the   idols   you worship besides Allah   all   are the fuel of Hell   You are going to enter it  
Every soul is to taste death and then to Us you shall be returned  
And those who persisted in fear of Allah will   also   be conducted to Paradise in groups   until when they approach it   Paradise     its doors will have been opened for them   well before   and the keepers of Paradise will say   greeting them     Peace be upon you   Be you glad and rejoicing   so enter it to live here forever  
Well   he whose breast Allah has opened for Islam is   stationed   in the light from his Lord     But on the contrary   they whose hearts are hardened for   being deprived of the Bounty of   Allahs remembrance are destined to ruin   It is they who are in open error  
It is they who follow Guidance from their Lord and it is they who shall achieve real success  
And well   matched young maidens  
So   his Lord granted him the prayer and removed the women   craft from him   Surely He is the One Who is All   Hearing   All   Knowing  
And his   damned   wretched   wife   too   who carries   on her head   the burden of   thorny   twigs   and spreads them in the way of Our Beloved   to injure his holy soles    
Then when   Ismail   Ishmael     reached   the age of   the ability to run about with him   Ibrahim   Abraham   said   O my son   I have seen in a dream that I am sacrificing you   So think   what is your opinion   Ismail   Ishmael   said   O my father   do that   immediately   which you are being commanded   If Allah wills   you will find me among the patient   and steadfast    
And apart from these two there are also two more gardens   for them    
And when   the Fire of   Hell will be burnt ablaze  
  O Listener     The Truth is from your Lord   So   never be of those who doubt  
On the Day when they   the believers   will meet Him   their gift   of the meeting greeting   will be   Peace   And He has kept ready for them most honourable reward  
In that   the Torah   We had prescribed for them   A life for a life   an eye for an eye   a nose for a nose   an ear for an ear   and a tooth for a tooth and in the case of injuries   too   there is a requital   But the person who   foregoes   this   requital   by way of charity   this will serve as an atonement for his   sins     And he who does not judge   and rule   in complia
And will help you with wealth and sons and will grow for you gardens and will make streams flow for you  
And if We defer their torment for a few fixed days   they will definitely say   What has held it back   Beware   The day when that   torment   comes upon them   then   that will not be averted from them   and that   chastisement   will beset them which they used to make fun of  
Say   Well   give your view   if this   Quran   is really   sent down   from Allah and you keep denying it   then who is more astray than he who is   engaged   in extreme opposition  
  And keep it in mind that   if Allah had willed   i   e   restricted their choice to one opinion only   they would never have fought among themselves   But Allah does what He desires  
The flames of pure   i   e   smokeless   fire will be sent upon both of you and   flameless   smoke   too will be sent   and you both will be unable to escape from them  
And made   them   secure from every rebellious Satan  
And always lower your arms of submissiveness and humility out of soft   heartedness for both of them and keep supplicating   Allah     O my Lord   have mercy on both of them as they brought me up in   my   childhood   with mercy and clemency    
When they have iron collars round their necks and chains   and they will be dragged away  
  O Believers     The palm   trees that you cut down or left standing upon their roots     during the siege of Banu Nadir tribe all this   was done by Allahs Command so that He might humiliate and disgrace the disobedient  
On that Day   We shall roll up the   whole   heavenly universe as the written papers are rolled up   The way We created   the universe   the first time   We shall repeat the same process of creation   after its extinction     We have made it binding upon Us to fulfil this promise   We will do   repeat it    
And by the morning when its light dawns  
And thickly planted dense gardens  
They shall be   held   under this   curse   forever   Their punishment shall not be mitigated   Nor shall they be given respite  
That is because they loved and preferred the life of this world to the Hereafter and because Allah does not guide the disbelieving folk  
And remember your Lord in your heart with humility and tearful submissiveness and fear and repentance   and also by calling in low tones     Persevere with His remembrance   morning and evening and be not of the neglectful  
Then   when   Ibrahim   Abraham     saw that their hands did not stretch towards that   dish     he took them as strangers and felt a little fear of them in   his   heart   They said   Do not be afraid   We have been sent to the people of Lut   Lot    
Surly the hypocrites   self   deluding   seek to deceive Allah while He is to make them suffer for their   own   deception   And when they stand up for Prayer   they do it sluggishly     simply   for showing off to the people   And they   also   remember Allah but little  
So recite the Quran as much as is easy for you   He knows that   some of   you will be ill and   some   others will be travelling in the land to look for Allahs bounty and   still some   others will be fighting in the way of Allah  
And I am giving them respite   indeed My grip is inescapable  
And the Day when   Allah   will call them and say   Where are those that you regarded as My partners and considered them   gods    
By the   angels   who violently snatch out   the souls of the disbelievers from each tendon and ligament of their body    
So Allah the True Sovereign is High and Exalted   There is no God but He   He alone is the Lord of the Venerated Throne   Authority    
  O My servant     Stay tenaciously in the companionship of those who remember their Lord morning and evening   ardently seeking His pleasure     keen on the glimpse of His sight and eagerly aspiring to glance at His radiant Countenance     Your   affectionate and caring   looks must not but focus them   Do you seek the charisma of the worldly life   shifting your attention away f
Surely those who have adopted piety   when some temptation from Satan touches them   they retrospect   the dos and donts of Allah and the wickedness and hostility of Satan     So   the eyes   of their insight   open up at the same instant  
And those of you who remain obedient to Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and persist in pious works   We shall give them double of their reward and We have prepared for them honourable sustenance   in Paradise    
And when they   themselves   give by measure or weigh to others they give them less  
So when the two parties came face to face the companions of Musa   Moses   said     Now   we are sure to be caught  
Verily   Allah chose Adam   and Nuh   Noah     and the family of Ibrahim   Abraham   and the family of Imran   in dignity   above all the people of the world  
That will rise over the hearts   with its torture    
He   thoroughly   executes whatever He intends  
Muhammad   blessings and peace be upon him   is not the father of any of your men   but he is the Messenger of Allah and the Last of the Prophets   ending the chain of the Prophets     And Allah is the Perfect Knower of everything  
So   it shall be merely a single Dreadful Shout   of a stern call     So all will suddenly   rise and   start staring  
Then for sure there will be scalding water mixed   with pus   for them after   eating   which will cut through the gut    
They ask you what they should spend   in the way of Allah     Say   Whatever wealth you spend   is right     but the deserving ones are your parents   and near relatives   and orphans   and the needy and the wayfarers   And whatever good you do   Allah indeed knows it full well  
There are some among them who   apparently   look towards you   Will you make the blind see the path even though they have no sight  
And surely after   this scenario that   We had destroyed the former   defiant   communities   We gave Musa   Moses   the Book which was   a rich source of   vision   guidance and mercy for the people so that they might take advice  
  They will live   in the Gardens of Bliss  
  Call to mind   the Day when We shall call every section of people along with their leaders   So whoever will be given the record of his deeds in his right hand   so they will read their records   rejoicing   and they will not be wronged a whit  
Surely We brought you the Truth but most of you disliked the Truth  
  All   that they long for will be   available   for them in these   gardens of Paradise     They shall live   in it   for ever   That is a coveted promise which your Lord has made a   bountiful   obligation upon Himself   and which will surely be fulfilled    
And we have ascertained that we can by no means come in the way of Allah   while living   in the earth   nor can we thwart Him by escaping   from the earth    
And for them will be hammers of iron   to strike their heads    
Has the account not reached you of those who have passed away before you   They were the people of Nuh   Noah   and   of the communities   of Ad and Thamud and   others   who came after them   No one knows them except Allah   because they have been totally annihilated from the surface of the earth     Their Messengers came to them with Clear Signs   So they put their hands into th
Woe to those who give less in measure or weight  
This day good and pure things have been made lawful for you   And the sacrificed animal of those given the   Revealed   Book is   also   lawful for you   while your sacrificed animal is lawful for them   And   likewise   chaste Muslim women as well as chaste women from amongst those given the Book before you   are lawful for you   when you have paid them their dower     provided  
And   recall   when Luqman said to his son   and he was advising him   O my son   do not set up partners with Allah   Verily associating partners with Allah is a very grave injustice  
Then We moved everyone who was of the believers in it out   from the town of the People of Lut   Lot      
And We have not wronged them but they were themselves the wrongdoers  
Say   O   my   people   Keep working at your position and surely I continue working   at my place     Then you shall soon come to know for whom it ends   well   in the Hereafter   Indeed the unjust will not be emancipated  
Then when the trumpet will be blown neither any relation will remain   intact   among them that Day   nor they will be able to ask of one another  
O People of the Book   Why do you dispute about Ibrahim     Abraham   i   e   why do you regard him as a Jew or a Christian       The truth is that the Torah and the Injil     the Gospel   on which both your religions are based   were sent down after his time   Have you not even   this much   sense  
  O Glorious Messenger     Let not their   hostile and malicious   conversation grieve you   Surely all Grandeur and Authority belongs to Allah alone   Who bestows upon whom He wills anything He may please     He is All   Hearing   All   Knowing  
Certainly you are   caught   in inconsistent statements  
So do not agree with what the beliers say  
So Allah rewarded them with Gardens   with streams flowing under them   in recompense of the submission they made   like a true believer   They   will live there forever and that is the wage of the righteous  
Truly in their stories there is a lesson of warning for men of understanding   This   Quran   is not a Revelation that can be forged but a confirmation of those   revealed Books   which were revealed before it   an explanation of everything and guidance and mercy for those who believe  
Allah is the One Who has made the night for you to repose in and brightened the day to see   surely Allah is Bountiful to mankind but most people do not give thanks  
So if you fear that both will be unable to keep within Allahs limits   then   in that case   there shall be no sin upon either of them if the wife   herself   may give up something as recompense to free herself   from this distressing bond    
On the Day when We shall assemble the Godfearing lot and take them   as guests of honour   to the Presence of the Most Kind   Lord   on carriages  
Except from their wives or the female slaves they possess   So   in this   there is no blame on them  
  It happens   so that Allah may make these   false ideas and absurd doubts   which Satan puts   into their minds   a trial for those people whose hearts are diseased   of hypocrisy   and whose hearts are hardened   owing to disbelief and disgust     And surely the wrongdoers are engaged in serious rivalry  
They are not all alike   Some of the People of the Book are   also   firmly committed to the Truth   They recite the Verses of Allah during the hours of night and remain in the state of prostration before their Lord  
Certainly those who sell the promise of Allah and their own oaths for a small price   it is they who will not have any share in the Hereafter   And on the Day of Resurrection Allah will neither speak to nor look at them and nor will He purify them   and for them will be painful punishment  
Surely We created man from a fertilized ovum that We keep turning and examining   from one stage to the next till birth     So We have made him   in the order of   hearing   then   seeing  
And what will make you understand what al   Hutama is   the crushing up Fire    
To Pharaoh and the chiefs   of his people     They too behaved with arrogance and conceit   And they too were   extremely   wrongdoing and disobedient people  
Say   before these disbelievers     Who is the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth   Say   yourself     Allah     Again   ask   them     Have you taken besides Allah   these idols   as your protectors who cannot control any profit or loss even for themselves   Say   Can the blind and the seeing be equal   Or can darkness and light be the same   Have they associated such partner
Or should say on seeing the torment   Could I return to the world but only once   I would then become one among the pious  
I said to them nothing except   that   which You ordered me to say   Worship   only   Allah Who is my Lord and your Lord   too     And I kept a vigilant watch over   their beliefs and actions   so long as I was among them   But when You lifted me up then You alone watched over their   affairs     and You are a Witness to everything  
We are your friends and helpers in the life of this world and in the Hereafter   too     And there is for you every blessing that you long for   And all those things are   available   for you there that you ask for  
Their Messengers said to them   Though   in constitution of self   we are humans like you   but   also mark the difference that   Allah favours whom He likes of His servants     Then how are you equal     And   as for clear proof   it is not for us to bring you a proof without Allahs decree   and the believers must put their trust in Allah alone  
These are the limits   prescribed   by Allah which He explains to those who have knowledge  
And verily your Lord alone is Almighty   Ever   Merciful  
Do they associate those who cannot create anything and have   themselves   been created as partners with Him  
Surely We have decorated the worlds heaven   the first heavenly sphere   with the adornment of stars and planets  
  O Beloved     The People of the Book ask you to bring down to them a Book from heaven   completely inscribed in one go     They asked Musa   Moses   for something even greater than that   they said   Show us Allah visibly   in Person     So owing to   their   transgression   i   e   this denigrating demand   a thunderbolt seized them     They died and were later raised to life b
Surely the residents of Paradise will be rejoicing today   in their   favourite pastime pursuits   like spiritual visits   entertainments   sessions of hymns and spiritual musical performance and other favours    
For   every   human being there are   angels   coming in succession who   before him and behind him   guard him by the Command of Allah   Verily   Allah does not change the state of a people until they bring about a change in themselves   And when Allah intends to torment a people   due to their own evil works     then none can avert it   Nor is there any helper for them apart fro
And whatever blessing you have been provided with is from Allah alone   Then   when some distress afflicts you   you wail and weep only before Him  
But   my responsibility is   to communicate from Allah His Commands and Messages   And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     surely there is for him the Fire of Hell in which they will live forever  
And I have indeed sought the protection of my Lord and your Lord lest you should stone me  
Have they not looked at the sky above them how We made it and   how   adorned it   and there is no crack in it  
O Believers   Do not make friends with the Jews and the Christians   They   all   are friends to one another   against you     And whoever of you makes friends with them will   also   become one of them   Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people  
They said   O our father   seek for us forgiveness   from Allah   for our sins   Indeed we alone are the sinners  
And We are relating to you all the news of the Messengers whereby We strengthen your   most purified   heart   And in this   chapter   there has come to you the Truth and Advice and a lesson of warning   and also a reminder   for the believers  
And when Musa   Moses   returned to his people pent up with anger and grief   he said   You have perpetrated a serious evil in my absence   after my departure     Did you make haste by the Command of your Lord   And   Musa   Moses     put down the Tablets   of the Torah   and catching his brothers head pulled him towards himself     Then   Harun   Aaron   said   O son of my mother
And when Our messengers   angels   came to Lut   Lot     he felt distressed   on their arrival   and felt depressed for their   intention to torment     And   the messengers   said   Do not feel afraid or grieved   We shall no doubt save you and your family except your wife   She is of those who will remain behind   for torment    
Surely in that is a mighty oath for the wise  
O Believers   Turn towards Allahs Presence in perfect and most sincere repentance   Your Lord will certainly remove your sins from you and admit you to the Gardens with streams flowing under them   On the Day when Allah will not slight   His   Prophet   blessings and peace be upon him   and those believers who are in his companionship   visibly or invisibly     their light will be
By no means   Soon will these   false gods themselves   reject their worship and become their enemies  
And We have not revealed to you the Book except that you may explain those   matters   clearly to them in which they differ   and   also that this Book   is guidance and mercy for the people that have embraced faith  
They said   You know it well that we have nothing to do with your   peoples   daughters   And you certainly know what we desire  
But We raised many generations   successively after Musa   Moses     and long ages passed over them   Nor were you living among the people of Madyan   like Musa   Moses and Shuaib   reciting Our Verses to them   But it is for Us to send   you exalting with tidings of the Unseen    
And among people there is also someone whose conversation seems to you pleasing in the life of the world and who calls Allah to witness that which is in his heart   but in truth he is most quarrelsome  
That it contains all that you like  
In fact for   the people of   Saba   Sheba   a sign did exist in their homeland itself     They   were two gardens   one on the right hand and the other on the left     They were commanded     Eat of the provision from your Lord and keep giving Him thanks     How   pure is   your   city and a Lord   Most Forgiving  
And We destroyed the people who were more powerful than these   disbelievers of Makka     And the annals of the bygone people have been cited   on many preceding occasions    
And We appointed the Qibla   direction of Prayer     which you used to face before   only to bring to light   by trial   who would follow   Our   Messenger and who would turn back upon his heels  
It shows the path of guidance   So we have believed in it and will never set up any partner with our Lord  
O Prophet   Remain firm in fearing Allah   with perseverance as before   and do not agree at all to what the disbelievers and the hypocrites say     conclude with us religious agreement     Surely Allah is All   Knowing   Most Wise  
And who guard their private parts   all the time    
O Believers   When it is said to you   Open up and make room in your gatherings   then open up and make room   Allah will provide you with ample room   And when it is said   Rise up   then rise up   Allah will raise those in ranks who believe from amongst you and who are given knowledge   And Allah is Well Aware of the works that you do  
So let them produce a treatise like this   Quran   if they are truthful  
Then by those parties that remember Allah   or   recite   the Holy Quran    
This very Hell is their reward because they kept disbelieving and mocking My Signs and My Messengers  
How can a person who has subjected himself to the will of Allah be like the one who has earned Allahs wrath   And Hell is his abode and that is an extremely evil dwelling  
And We will keep giving them fruits and meat more and more as they desire  
And when the anger of Musa   Moses   became sublimated   he picked up the Tablets   and in the inscription of these   Tablets   was   mentioned   guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord much  
So when I accomplish bringing his   physical   constitution into its perfect real being and breathe My   Divine   Spirit into   the inner self of   this   human physical   organism   then fall down prostrate before him  
These are the people who have purchased misguidance for guidance   but their trade did not yield any gain and they did not know the way to   gainful and profitable   bargain  
When they said to their Prophet   Appoint for us a king so that we may fight in the cause of Allah   under his command    
No one disputes about the Revelations of Allah except those who do not believe   So let not their moving about   freely   in the cities delude you  
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and all that is in the earth   and enough is Allah to be the Guardian  
You worship idols besides Allah and fabricate mere lies   Surely those you worship instead of Allah are not masters of your sustenance   So always seek sustenance from Allah   and worship Him alone   and submit thanks to Him   You will be returned to Him alone  
And who is a greater wrongdoer than one who was reminded of the Signs of Allah but he turned away from them and forgot those   evil deeds   which his hands had sent forward   Verily We have cast veils over their hearts so that they may   not   understand this Truth and have plugged their ears with heaviness   so that they may not hear this Truth     And if you invite them towards 
And you see the earth completely dry   i   e   dead   and when We shower water on it   a stir of freshness and fertility runs through it  
But the one who corrupts himself   in sins and suppresses virtue   is doomed indeed  
Read and your Lord is Most Generous  
Surely those who believe and do good deeds persistently shall have the Gardens of Paradise as their hospitality  
Musa   Moses   said   You will certainly find me patient   if Allah so pleases   and I will not violate any of your instructions  
There is none worthy of worship except Allah   He alone is the Master of the Supreme Throne of Authority  
And He will sublimate distress and fury in their hearts   and will accept repentance of whom He wills   And Allah is All   Knowing   Most Wise  
And     O Esteemed Prophet     We have not sent you but as a Bearer of the glad tidings and as a Warner to the entire mankind   but most people do not know  
Allah said   So   indeed   you are among those granted respite  
Then when the Truth came to them from Our Presence   they said   Why has this   Messenger   not been given the   Signs   like those   Signs   which were given to Musa   Moses     Did they not deny those   Signs   which were given to Musa   Moses   before this   They said   Both   the Quran as well as the Torah   are magic   which   confirm and agree with each other   And they said
But if they resolve firmly to divorce   then certainly Allah is All   Hearing   All   Knowing  
And   He has made me   treat my mother with excellent morality and has not made me disobedient and ill   fated  
Say   Spend willingly or unwillingly   this   money   will not be accepted from you at all   You are indeed a disobedient people  
Say   If I disobeyed My Lord   I would fear the torment of a Terrible Day  
So   sufficient is Allah as witness between us and you   for we were   certainly   unaware of your worship  
That   letter   has indeed   come   from Sulaiman   Solomon     and that begins with the Name of Allah   Who is Most Kind   Ever   Merciful  
He is the One Who has made the night for you so that you may rest and relax therein   and made the day bright   so that therein you may do your work     Surely there are Signs in it for those who listen   attentively    
the Prophet said   to them     What   if you desist from fighting once it is prescribed for you  
And He is the One Who created and then scattered you in the earth and before Him will you be gathered  
That Day True Sovereignty will belong to the Most Kind   Lord   and that will be very hard   i   e   tough   Day on the disbelievers  
And the people of the Injil     the Gospel   too   are required to judge in accordance with that   Commandment   which Allah has sent down in it   And he who does not judge   and run the state   complying with the commandments Allah has revealed   it is they who are unruly and wicked  
So   do not pay any heed to him   because he is wealthy and has children  
He who seeks the harvest in the Hereafter   We grant him further increase in his harvest   And he who desires the harvest of this world We give him some of it   but in the Hereafter there does not remain any share for him  
  Allah   said   O Iblis   what has prevented you from falling down prostrate before his   Exalted Person   whom I have created with My Own   Benevolent   Hand   Did you show arrogance   to him   or were you   presuming yourself   high ranking  
So   at that time     I went out of your   line of control   when I feared your   designs     Then my Lord bestowed on me the Commandment   of Prophethood   and   finally   made me one of the Messengers  
They said   Verily   we are to return to our Lord  
His speech is nothing but outright Revelation   which is sent to him  
And He will   ultimately   admit them to Paradise which He has   already   made well known to them  
Indeed this   enlightenment   is   also contained   in earlier scriptures  
Inquire   of them     Is there any of your   so   called   partner   gods that may lead to the Truth   Say   Allah alone guides to the Truth   Din   Religion       Then who has greater right to be obeyed He who guides to the Truth or he who himself does not find the way unless he is shown the way     i   e   it should be carried from one place to the other as the disbelievers used
But that   If Allah so wills     i   e   saying   Insha Allah     And remember your Lord when you forget and say   I believe my Lord will show me the path of guidance which is   even   nearer than this one  
Those who are miserly and bid others   also   to be miserly   and hide that   blessing   which Allah has granted them of His Bounty   And We have prepared a disgraceful torment for the disbelievers  
And     O man     if some evil impulse from Satan provokes you   against these matters     seek refuge with Allah   Undoubtedly   He is All   Hearing   All   Knowing  
  O Most Esteemed Messenger     Relate to these people the account of two sons of Adam   Habil and Qabil   Abel and Cain     which is absolutely true   When both of them made offering   one each to Allah     the offering from one of them   Habil   Abel     was accepted while that from the other   Qabil   Cain     was not accepted   Thereupon   he   Qabil   Cain     said to Habil  
And He is the One Who held back the hands of those   disbelievers   from you and your hands from them on the frontier of Makka   near al   Hudaibiya   after giving you the upper hand over their   party     And Allah best monitors what you do  
He was indeed of Our servants blessed with   perfect   faith  
On that Day every person will be in such a   dismal   state that will make him unconcerned   with everyone else    
Indeed We sent Nuh   Noah   to his people   So he said   O my people   Worship Allah   you have no other God except He   Verily I fear for you the torment of a dreadful Day  
Do you think that you will be spared   without passing through troubles and hardships     while Allah has not   yet   made distinctly known those amongst you who have fought in the way of Allah and   who   have not taken anyone as a confidant besides Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and the believers   And Allah is Well   Aware of the deeds that you do  
And when the idolaters see their   self   made   partners   they will say   O our Lord   these are our partner   gods which we worshipped besides You   Thereupon those   partner   gods   will send them the message   in reply     You are liars indeed  
They said   We seek   only   to eat of it so that our hearts are satiated and we know   with added certitude   that you have told us the Truth and we bear witness   to the descent of the table    
And when he reached his full manhood   We endowed him with the judgment   of Prophethood   and the knowledge   of the interpretation of dreams     This is how We bless the pious with reward  
No soul should be stressed beyond its capacity   and   neither the mother nor the father should be harmed for the child
