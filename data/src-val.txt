As if it is about to burst into pieces with intense wrath   When a group will be cast into it   its guards will ask them   Did no Warner come to you

The likeness of this lamp of Prophethood is as if   its oil   i   e   Light   due to its genuine and inherent potential capability   is glowing   though no fire   or the radiation of celestial miracles and divine revelation   has even touched it yet  
  Now the only solution is     Kill Yusuf   Joseph   or banish him to some distant unknown place     Thus   your fathers attention will be focused purely on you and after that become a band of righteous people   by turning towards Allah in repentance    
And by the heaven with its galaxies and orbits   of stars and planets    
O Believers   Fear Allah persistently and keep looking for means to   approach and get closer to   Him and strive hard in His way so that you may prosper

Those who live on usury will not be able to stand   on the Day of Judgment   but like the one whom Satan has made insane with his touch   damnation     This is because they used to say that trade   buying and selling   is similar to usury whereas Allah has declared trading   buying and selling   lawful and usury unlawful   So   if someone refrained   from usury   on receiving admo

  How wonderfully   have you made your dream really true   Surely We pay back the spiritually excellent the same way     So you are blessed with the prominence of Our closest friend

And the disbelievers also sought to shake you off the land   of Makka   so that they might banish you from here     But had that supposedly happened   then they   themselves   would also not have stayed there but for a little while  
Surely whoever comes to his Lord as an evildoer   certainly for him is Hell     And it is such a torment   wherein he will neither die nor survive  
And   now   those of you who are exalted   Din Religionwise   and affluent   worldwise   must not swear that they will not provide   financial help   to the relatives   the needy and the emigrants   who were involved in this offence of false accusation     They should forgive   their misconduct   and overlook   their mistake     Do you not like that Allah should forgive you   And

Calling towards the Truth   i   e   the Oneness of Allah   is for Him alone   And those   false gods   idols   they   i   e   disbelievers   worship besides Him cannot give them any answer at all   Their example is like the one who   sits   stretching both his palms towards water so that it may reach his mouth   itself     but it   i   e   water   reaches not   like this     And

This   torment   is because Allah never changes any blessing that He grants affluently to some people till they change their blessed state themselves   i   e   when they commit ingratitude   disobedience and sins and even lose the sense of loss they are seized by destruction and devastation     Allah is indeed All   Hearing   All   Knowing  
So that Allah may separate the impious from the pious and put the impious   filthy characters   one over the other and heap them all up together and then cast this   heap   into Hell   It is they who are the losers

They said   We give you good news which is true   So do not lose hope  
So they rejected him   Hud   and We destroyed them   Surely in this   incident   there is a great Sign   of Allahs Infinite Power   and most of them were not the believers

So do you wonder at this Revelation  
And We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them without any purpose and good reason   It is the view and concept of the disbelievers   that this is a purposeless creation that came about by chance     So for disbelievers there is torment of the Fire of Hell  
And what is the matter with you that you do not spend in the Way of Allah whereas the ownership of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah alone   you are merely His vicegerents     Those of you who spent   their wealth in the Way of Allah before Makkan Victory   and fought   they   and you   cannot be equal   They are far higher in rank than those who spent their wealth afterw
Assuredly   Allah does not forgive   the sin of   setting up any partner with Him   but He forgives any   sin   lesser than that whom He wills   And the one who associates anything with Allah as His partner has surely strayed far off  
And peace be on Yahya   John   the day he was born   the day he dies and the day he will be raised up alive

And certainly these   disbelievers   have passed by that town on which was showered a disastrous rain   of stones     Did they not see that   ruined town     But the truth is that they do not expect to be raised up   after death    
  This is   so because Allah may torment the hypocrites   men and women   and the polytheists   men and women   and Allah may accept repentance of the believers   men and women   And Allah is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
  O Beloved     See what similes   these people   find for you   So they have gone astray   Now they are unable to find a way to the right path

Their example is like a person who lit a fire   in surrounding darkness   and when it brightened the environment   Allah took away their light and left them in total darkness   Now they cannot see anything  
Surely the Last Hour is bound to come   There is no doubt in that   Yet most people do not believe  
So set off with your family sometime during the night and follow them in the rear and none of you must   even   look back   and proceed to the place   where   you have been commanded to  
Then you shall certainly see it with the eye of certitude  
Surely they imagine that   Day   to be far off  
So those who believe and keep doing good deeds   for them are Gardens of eternal repose as an entertainment and honour   from their Lord   in reward for those   works   which they used to do  
And     O Beloved     remember   Hud     the kinship brother of the people of Ad   when he warned his people   of the dire consequences of their evil deeds   in al   Ahqaf     the Sand   Dunes   a valley in Yemen   between Uman   Oman   and Mahra     although   a number of   Warners   Messengers   had passed before and after him     saying     Worship no one but Allah   I fear for

Then they said   O our Lord   place between our break   journey points longer distances   And they wronged their souls   So We made them tales   for a lesson of warning     And We disintegrated them into pieces and scattered them   Surely there are signs in it for a greatly patient and highly thankful person  
And what do you know   Perhaps he would be purified   further owing to your attending to him    
O my two companions of the prison     The interpretation of the dream of   one of you   is that he   will serve wine to his master   the king     and as for the other     who has seen bread on his head     he will be crucified and then birds will pick at his head   The   final   judgment has been given about which you have asked  
And if two parties of the Muslims fight   make them reconcile   Then if either of these   parties   commits injustice and aggression against the other   fight against that   party   who are committing aggression till they turn to Allahs command   When they revert and submit   make peace between them with equity   And put justice to work   Surely Allah loves those who do justice

And those whom We have given the Book   the Torah   if they are true believers   then   they rejoice at this   Quran   which has been revealed to you   And also some from among their sects are those who deny a part of it   Say   I have been given only this command that I worship Allah and must not associate   any   partner with Him   I invite towards Him alone   and to Him have I

So those who believe and always do pious deeds will be pleased and delighted in the Gardens of Paradise  
And I am designing My own Strategy  
And that only a fool from among us used to utter things about Allah far from the Truth   crossing bounds  
Ta   Sin     Only Allah and the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   know the real meaning     These are the Verses of the   Holy   Quran and an enlightening Book
They rejoice in these   blessings of eternal life   which Allah has conferred on them of His Bounty and also feel pleased   on finding   their successors   on the path of faith and obedience     who have not   yet   joined them   for they shall also have neither any fear nor any grief

And keep watching them   constantly     So they will soon come to know   their end    
That is because they said to those who dislike the Book revealed by Allah   We shall obey you in certain matters   And Allah knows best their secret consultations  
Indeed the tree bearing thorny fruit  
There will   also   be no sin on you if you divorce   the wedlocked   women even before touching them or fixing their dower   Then   in this case   provide for them appropriately   It is   an obligation   for the rich according to his means and for the poor according to his means     In any case   this provision must be made in a becoming manner   This is compulsory for the pious 
Do you wonder that direction and guidance from your Lord has come   on the tongue   of a man from among yourselves so that he may warn you   of the chastisement of Allah     and that you become Godfearing   and the purpose is that Mercy may be shown to you  
It is neither the meat   of slaughtered animals   nor their blood that reaches Allah at all but it is the Godwariness that reaches Him from you   Thus has Allah subjected them to you so that you may proclaim Allahs greatness   while sacrificing   the way He has guided you   And give glad tidings to those who practise spiritual excellence  
And   recall the time   when We raised the mountain over them as though it were a canopy and they feared it was about to fall on them     So We said to them   Do not fear   instead   hold fast to that   Book pragmatically   which We have given you and bear well in mind those   injunctions   which are   contained   in it so that you are protected   from the torment    
So how My torment and My warning were  
And by the   angels   who unweave sinews   of the believers organisms   gently and peacefully

And to Sulaiman     Solomon   We subjected   the violent wind which used to blow by his command   from all sides and directions   towards   Syria     the land in which We have placed Blessings   And We know everything   full   well  
Yet you go for the   pleasures of   the worldly life   instead of turning towards Allah    
In order that Allah may recompense in full those who believe and continue doing good deeds   It is they for whom there is forgiveness and honourable sustenance   for the Last Day    
This is how We sort out   the matter   with the evildoers  
And whoever has brought the Truth and he who has confirmed it   it is they who are Godfearing  
  Throwing Yusuf   Joseph   into the well   they came to their father at night weeping   deceptively    
In fact everyone of them desires that he should be given   directly   open scrolls of   heavenly   Scriptures  
And We certainly have the Power to show you that   torment   of which We are making them a promise  
Surely Allah blesses them with His   special   companionship who live with Godwariness and who   also   live with spiritual excellence  
And you will yourselves come to know its Truth after a while  
And many an animal there is that does not carry its sustenance   with it     Allah provides for them and for you too   And He is All   Hearing   All   Knowing  
Two men from among   a few   who feared   Allah   and whom Allah had favoured with His Blessing   said to their folk     Enter the gate   of the city invading   these people   dauntlessly     Once you enter this   gate     you will certainly be victorious   And put your trust in Allah alone provided you are people of faith  
And they will not be helped   against Allahs decree    
And   the serving   youths will go round them   as if they were pearls kept hidden in covers  
And do not be like those who said   by way of betraying     We have heard   whereas they do not hear  
And We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them merely in sport  
  They are the ones   who   when afflicted with some distress   say   Indeed   we too are Allahs   belongings   and to Him are we to return  
He Who produces fire for you out of the green tree so now you kindle fire with the same

It is they whose reward is forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens beneath which rivers flow   They will reside therein permanently   What an excellent reward there is for those who execute righteous acts  
These are the towns whose news We are narrating to you   Surely their Messengers came to them with Clear Signs   But   even then   they remained inert to believe in what they had rejected before   That is how Allah seals up the hearts of the disbelievers

And   the servants   will go round them with vessels of silver and   pure and clean   goblets of shining glass  
If even then you turn away then I have literally brought you   all those Commandments   with which I have been sent to you   And my Lord will appoint some other people in your place as your successors   and you can do Him no harm at all   Surely my Lord is Protector of everything  
And those who disbelieve are the allies of one another     O Muslims     If you do not extend   to one another   the same   help and cooperation for the cause of Allah     then great mischief and disruption   for the dominance of infidelity and falsehood   will break out in the land  
Of course there are many commitments for you during the day  
But those whose scales   of righteous deeds   are light   it is they who have harmed their souls because they had been unjust to Our Revelations  
There is a severe torment for those who disbelieve and there is forgiveness and a mighty reward for those who believe and keep doing pious deeds  
They ask   When is the Day of Requital  
Say   Travel in the land then see how   alarming   was the end of the people before you   Most of them were polytheists  
And among them are   also   some who keep their ears towards you and   in view of their evil intentions   We have wrapped their hearts in veils     So   it is not possible for them now   that they may understand it   the Quran   and   We have   plugged their ears   And even if they see all Signs   naked     they   still   will not believe in them   so much so that when they approa
  Due to their own malice   We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away from   accepting the Truth the same way   as they have disbelieved   in the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     the first time     So   they will not believe even on seeing the Sign     And We shall leave them to wander astray in their rebellion and defiance

Say   If I were to lose the straight path   the sin   or harm   of losing the straight path would afflict only my soul   and if I am rightly guided it is so because my Lord sends His Revelation to me   Surely He is All   Hearing   Ever   Near

Then various sects cropped up among them   So those who did wrong   woe to them on account of the torment of a grievous Day  
  The case of these disbelievers is also like that of   the people of Pharaoh and those who preceded them   They   too   denied the Revelations of Allah   So   Allah seized them   with torment   for their sins   Surely   Allah is Mighty   Severe in afflicting torment

The case of those who were burdened with   the Commandments and teachings of   the Torah   but   then did not bear it   i   e   this Messenger was mentioned in it but they disbelieved in him   is like that of a donkey loaded with heavy books on its back   How evil is the example of those who have rejected Allahs Revelations   And Allah does not guide the wrongdoers

And do not eat of   the meat of the animal   over which the Name of Allah has not been pronounced   at the time of slaughter     Verily   it is a sin   to eat that meat     And surely the devils keep pouring   doubts   into the hearts of their companions so that they may dispute with you   And if you follow their instructions     then   you will also become polytheists  
Then certainly on the Day of Resurrection you will dispute with one another in the Presence of your Lord     One party will say to the other   You stopped us from understanding the station of the Prophet and the glory of the Messenger   They will reply   No   you were yourselves ill   fated and misguided

And that when the servant of Allah   Muhammad   blessings and peace be upon him     stood up to worship Him they thronged around him   to listen to his recitation    
Then it will be said to them   Where are those   idols   which you used to set up as partners  
Has the direction and guidance   Revelation   been sent down to him alone out of all of us   The truth is that he is a great liar   self   conceited   and arrogant    
And Most Blessed is He to Whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and   also of all   that is between them   And He has the knowledge of the Last Hour   as well     and you will be returned to Him alone  
Or do they say   He   the Prophet   is   afflicted   with mania     Nay   not at all     he has rather brought to them the Truth but most of them do not like the Truth  
On that Day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   would wish that   after burying them   the earth over them were levelled   And they will not be able to hide anything from Allah  
And the Day when the enemies of Allah will be gathered and driven to Hell   they will be impeded   shepherded   and driven   forcefully    
The Exalter of Ranks and the Owner of the Mighty Throne   He sends His Spirit   i   e   Revelation   upon whoever of His servants He wills by His Command   so that He may warn them   people   of the Day of Assembly  
And had Allah seized people   instantly   for their injustice   He would not have left any living being   on the surface of the earth     But He grants them respite till an appointed term   When their fixed time arrives then they can neither advance nor hold it back for a single moment  
And the ranks   in Paradise and Hell   are allocated for all   separately   according to the   good and evil   deeds which they do   so that   Allah   pays them back in full for their actions and they shall not be wronged at all  
And We delivered him and his family from the ordeal  
  He   is the Knower of   all things   hidden and disclosed   So He is Exalted   High above all what they associate with Him  
And they swear by Allah most earnestly that Allah will not resurrect him who dies   No Indeed   The true promise is a bountiful obligation upon Him   but most people do not know  
It is they for whom there is a share of their   virtuous   earning   and Allah is Swift at reckoning  
Allah releases the provision abundantly for whom He pleases and restrains   for whom He wills     And these   disbelievers   are greatly charmed by the worldly life whereas   in contrast with the life in the Hereafter   the worldly life is nothing but a worthless provision  
And if you call them to   the path of   guidance   they will not follow you   For you it is all the same whether you call them   towards guidance and truth   or you remain silent  
No indeed   You will soon learn   this reality that wealth and riches will avail you nothing    
  The one   who should be my heir   of divine blessing   and also the heir of   the chain of Prophethood from   the Children of Yaqub   Jacob     And   O my Lord   You   also   make him an awardee of Your Pleasure  
Surely your   sitting for long in this   manner discomforts the Holy Prophet   blessings and peace be upon him     and he feels reluctant to   ask   you   to leave   but Allah does not hesitate in   saying   the Truth  
And when the wrongdoers see the torment   neither will   this torment   be mitigated for them   nor will they be granted any respite  
And if We had so willed   We would have obliterated the very marks of their eyes   Then if they would have run on the path   how could they have seen  
That is a Book whose contents are in harmony with one another   in format and meaning   and   whose Verses   are repeated frequently  
Say   Indeed the earlier and the later  
Doubtlessly   the life of the world is nothing but merely a sport and pastime   And if you believe and adopt Godwariness   He will pay you the recompense   of your deeds in full     and will not require of you your wealth  
Then much evil came to be the end of those who did evil because they used to belie the Revelations of Allah and used to ridicule them  
The Trusted Spirit   Gabriel   has descended with it  
By the night when it covers up   and conceals everything in its darkness    
Now even if they keep patience   their abode is Hell   and if they seek to earn   Allahs   pleasure   by turning to Him in repentance     even then they will not be among those who attain to Allahs pleasure  
And your Lord has commanded you not to worship anyone other than Allah and treat the parents with benevolence   If either or both of them attain to old age in your presence   then do not say even Ugh   to them nor reproach them   And always speak to both of them submissively   observing polite manners  
And   have We also not   shown him the two highways   of good and evil    
  O Beloved   Now   this matter is not your concern whether Allah enables them to repent or torments them   because they are the transgressors  
And seek forgiveness from your Lord   then turn to Him in repentance   with true hearts     Indeed my Lord is Ever   Merciful   Most Loving  
They said   By Allah   you will continue remembering Yusuf     Joseph   alone   till you get near death or pass away  
O Believers   Do not step ahead of Allah and His Messenger     blessings and peace be upon him   in any matter   and keep fearing Allah   lest some discourtesy should occur displeasing the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him       Surely Allah is All   Hearing   All   Knowing  
And they have rejected   the Truth even now   and followed their vain desires   And everything   that has been promised   is to take place at the appointed time  
And armies for Sulaiman   Solomon   were collected from among   all species of   the jinn   human beings and birds   So they were held on   in his service   for discipline and training  
then   nourish you   so that you may reach your youth   And of you are   also   some who die   early   and some are brought to quite a worthless age so that   he may see this state too that   having learnt so much knowledge   now he knows   just   nothing   once more    
So these are their houses lying ruined   for they committed oppression and injustice   No doubt there is a Sign   of Warning   in it for those who have knowledge  
But when the eyes will be dazzled  
Surely the pious will be   rejoicing   in gardens and springs  
The chiefs of Pharaohs people said   He is for sure   some   expert magician  
If you see   them at the time   when they will be made to stand   on the verge of   the Fire they will say   Would that we were sent back   to the world     then we would not   at all   belie the Signs of our Lord and would be of the believers  
  O Esteemed Beloved     When the hypocrites come to you they say   We bear witness that you are certainly the Messenger of Allah   And Allah knows that surely you are His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     But Allah bears witness that undoubtedly the hypocrites are liars  
Musa   Moses   said   That is the place we were looking for   So both returned to   the same place     tracing the   same track   following their footsteps  
And it is no sin on you if you seek   also   your Lords bounty   through trade during Hajj   Pilgrimage   days     Then when you return from Arafat   celebrate the remembrance of Allah near Mashar al   Haram   Muzdalifa     And remember Him as He has guided you   And you were certainly wandering disorientated before  
They said     O Musa   Moses     Moses       We were persecuted before you came to us and after your arrival as well     We have suffered both ways   When will our misery end     Musa     Moses   appeasing his people   said   Your Lord would soon destroy your enemy and   then   make you the successors   to the governance   in the land and He will then monitor how you perform   aft
And fear Allah and know that Allah is watchful of all that you do  
Woe to everyone who slanders   face to face   and finds fault   in absence    
And     O Beloved     how many a town have We destroyed whose citizens wielded greater power   i   e   resources and authority   than   the residents of   your city   Makka   whose   powerful chiefs   have driven you out   by emigration     We have destroyed them as well and no one came to their help   who could save them    
Is   all   that available for man what he longs for    
Everyone of you who aspires to tread the straight path   can take guidance from this source spring    
Whether he   the whispering Satan   comes from the jinn or mankind  
And We strengthened and stabilized their hearts   through Our communication and divine affinity     When they stood   before their king     they said   Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth   We shall never worship any   false   god besides Him     If we do that   then we shall certainly say something profane  
And so do We elucidate in detail the Revelations   and this is   in order that the pattern of behaviour of the evildoers may become distinctly known   to all    
Then We shall deliver the God   fearing and shall leave the wrongdoers in it   Hell   down on their knees  
And pay the women their dower with a pleased heart   Then if they forgo for you some   of the dower   out of their own pleasure   you may consume it as pleasant and favourable   for you    
Verily you go after men for your lust leaving the women   you are in truth given to transgression  
And you have made your means of subsistence   and fortune   to reject it  
When He brought upon you drowsiness to   provide you   feeling of peace and security from Himself and sent down upon you water from the heavens to provide you   inward and outward   purity by that and remove from you the filth of Satans   heretic suspicions   and invigorate your hearts with   the strength of certitude   and with that make your feet   unshakably   firm  
They have made their oaths a shield   Then they hinder   the people   from the path of Allah   Surely that is an extremely evil   work   which they are doing  
  Musa   Moses     said   Samiri     tell me     what is the matter with you  
And Allah is He Who has raised aloft the heavens   in space   without pillars   as   you see   then He settled Himself on the Throne of His Authority   encompassing the entire universe befitting His glory   and fettered the sun and the moon to a system   each moving   in its respective orbit to complete its rotation   during its appointed term   He alone devises strategies for the
Surely those who disbelieved and died while they were disbelievers   if anyone of them offers an earthful of gold as ransom   for his salvation   that shall not at all be accepted from him   It is they for whom there is painful torment   And no helper will be possible for them  
and Allah   entrusts   with His kingdom whom He pleases and Allah is Infinite   All   Knowing  
They said   O Nuh   Noah     if you do not stop   saying these things     then surely you will be stoned to death  
Then   if they turn away   say   I have conveyed to you all alike   and I do not know   on my own   whether that   torment   which you are promised is near or far  
And glorify Him morning and evening  
And the disbelievers said to their Messengers   We will banish you by all means from our country   or you will have to return to our faith   Their Lord then revealed to them   We shall certainly destroy the unjust people  
And when they commit some indecency they say   We found our ancestors on the same   way   and Allah has enjoined the same upon us   Say   Allah does not enjoin acts of indecency   Do you say about   the Essence of   Allah such things as you do not know   even   yourselves  
They said   O our people   O community of jinn     indeed we have heard such a Book that has been revealed after   the Torah of   Musa   Moses   It   confirms   the Books   that came before it and guides to the true   Din   Religion     and the straight road  
It is these people who are hastening in   collecting   good works and it is they who excel in this pursuit  
The angels closest   to Allah   remain present here  
Verily those who do not expect to meet Us and are pleased with the worldly life and are well contented with it and who are neglectful of Our Signs  
When swift horses of fine breed were presented to him in the evening  
  Pharaoh   said   So   what was the fate of former people   who did not believe in your Lord    
And those who have been given the Book definitely know that this   commandment of changing Qibla   is the Truth from their Lord  
And   also recall the time   when We made an appointment with Musa   Moses   for forty nights   Then after Musa   Moses went into retreat   you took the calf as   your   god for worship and you were no doubt aweful transgressors  
And the King said   Bring him to me so that I may appoint him specifically   as an adviser   to me   So   when the King had   one   to   one   dialogue with him   he felt highly impressed and   said     O Yusuf   Joseph       surely from today onward you are a man of authority and trust with us   i   e   you are inducted into the governance of the state    
But when He tries him   by afflicting pain and discomfort   and limits his means of sustenance   he says   My Lord has humiliated me  
It was by far a great open trial  
So Allah alone is the Master of the Hereafter and the world  
And We made the people   i   e   the Children of Israel   who were powerless and oppressed the inheritors of the east and the west of the land   Egypt and Syria   wherein We had placed blessing   And   in this way   a fair promise of your Lord with the Children of Israel was fulfilled because they remained steadfast   in the face of Pharaohs tyranny and oppression     And We destr
Satan makes you afraid of poverty   to stop you from spending in the way of Allah   and enjoins you to commit indecency   And Allah promises you His forgiveness and bounty   And Allah is All   Embracing   All   Knowing  
And We have made for you bigger sacrificial animals   i   e   camels and cows   etc     from among the Signs of Allah   There is good in them for you   So line   them   up and   after lancing at the time of their slaughter   invoke the Name of Allah over them   Then   when they fall down on their sides   eat of it   too   and feed those who are sitting contented as well as the   n
And if you do not believe in me then keep away from me  
So they   the believers   should fight in the cause of Allah   for the promotion of good and human dignity   who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter   And whoso fights in the way of Allah   whether he   himself   gets slain or wins victory     in both cases   We shall soon bless him with great reward  
And become not like those who split into sects and dissented even after manifest Signs had reached them   And it is they who would suffer grievous torment  
And   the ignorant of its value   say   If we follow the guidance in your company   we will be snatched out of our land   Have We not made them settle in   this   secure and peaceful Sanctuary   Makka   your own land   where all kinds of fruits are supplied   from all over the world   as sustenance from Us   But most of them do not know   for whose sake this whole process operates
So   first   those on the Right Hand   what a class will the Right Hand be  
O Believers   Do not follow the footsteps of Satan   and whoever follows the footsteps of Satan   then he   Satan   certainly commands to practise   and promote   immorality and sinful deeds   And if there had not been Allahs Grace and His Mercy upon you then none of you would ever have been pure   from the stain of the sin of slander     But Allah purifies whom He wills and Allah
And when they said   sarcastically     O Allah   If this   Quran   is really the Truth from Your side   then rain down upon us stones from the sky   for disobeying it   or seize us with some grievous torment  
So     O Beloved     by your Lord they cannot become true believers until they make you a judge in every dispute that arises among them   and thereafter they do not feel any resentment in their hearts against the judgment that you make   and submit   to your decision   gladly   with total submission  
Do they seek some Din   Religion   other than Allahs   And whoever is in the heavens and the earth has embraced His obedience   whether   by choice or by constraint   and to Him shall they all be returned  
They started disputing with you about the cause of Truth even after disclosure   of the good news that help from Allah would arrive and the forces of Muhammad would triumph   blessings and peace be upon him       as if they were being driven towards death and could see   death with their eyes    
And when it was said   The promise of Allah is true and there is no doubt about   the coming of   the Last Hour   you used to say   We do not know what the Last Hour is   nor do we have any faith in it  
Then what will be   their plight at the time   when the angels will snatch out their souls   this way   that they will be striking their faces and their backs  
And there is indeed another section of them who   while reciting the Book   twist their tongues so that you may take their inverted expressions as   part of   the Book whereas it is not from the Book   And they say   It is   all   from Allah   while it is not   at all   from Allah   They invent a lie against Allah and they know   it   themselves as well  
But if they do not accept what you say then know that   they do not have any logic     they merely follow their lusts   And who can be more astray than the one who follows his desire abandoning the Guidance from Allah   Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoers  
O People of the Book   Why do you confound the Truth with falsehood and why do you hide the Truth whereas you know  
You are but a human being like us   so bring some Sign if you are truthful  
  It is   they whom We gave the Book and the Authority of Judgement   Sharia   and Prophethood   Then if these people   i   e   the disbelievers   deny these things   We have indeed appointed such people   to believe in these things   who   will   never deny them  
This   Quran   is but admonition   revealed   for all the worlds  
The Day when this   gold   silver and wealth   will be heated in the Fire of Hell   their foreheads   sides and backs will be branded with this   heated material   and it will be said to them     This is the same   wealth   that you treasured for   the benefit of   your souls   So taste   this wealth   which you had been amassing  
  O Beloved     Surely you neither make the dead   i   e   the disbelievers deprived of the vitality of faith   hear your call nor the deaf   i   e   deprived of hearing the call of Truth   while they are getting away   from you   turning their backs  
Turning his neck   in arrogance   so that he may lead   others also   astray from the path of Allah   For him is disgrace in the world   too   and on the Day of Resurrection We shall make him taste the burning torment  
And a dreadful Blast overtook the wrongdoers   So morning found them   dead   lying prone in their homes  
Indeed those who remain restless and tremble with fear of their Lord  
Has He chosen daughters as compared to sons     The creed of the disbelievers of Makka is being refuted in the language of their logic and mentality    
Verily it is your Lord Who will gather them together   on the Day of Resurrection     Surely He is Most Wise   All   Knowing  
So that we   both   may amply glorify You  
If Allah were to hasten evil   i   e   torment   for the   disbelieving   people   as they make haste for the worldly gains   then certainly their term   of life   would have been   hastily   completed for them   so that they reach Hell fast after dying     But We leave those who do not expect to meet Us in their rebellion   and revolt   so that they keep wandering disoriented  
Say   Those who are in the heavens and the earth do not have the knowledge of the unseen   by themselves   except Allah   Who is Self   Knowing     nor do they know when they will be raised up   alive again    
And your Lord does not destroy the towns until He sends to their capital city a Messenger who recites to them Our Verses   And We do not destroy towns unless their dwellers are given to oppression  
So leave them   in their plight   till they meet that Day of theirs when they will be destroyed  
And when those who believe in Our Revelations come to you   then say   affectionately     Peace be upon you   Your Lord has made Mercy incumbent upon Himself   as a gracious obligation     So whoever from amongst you commits some evil out of ignorance   or suspension of discretion   but later turns to   Allah in   repentance and amends   himself     then surely He is Most Forgivin
  That   scorches the skin and blackens it  
And     O Beloved   recall   when We took a covenant from the Prophets   to preach faith in their Prophethood   and   specially   from you and from Nuh   Noah   and from Ibrahim   Abraham   and Musa   Moses   and Isa   Jesus   son of Mayam   Mary   and We took from them a solemn covenant  
And those who believe and do pious deeds then We shall certainly admit them to the   group   of the most pious  
Do they seek the law of   the days of   ignorance   And who is better than Allah in   giving   judgment for a people who have firm faith  
And it is out of His Mercy that He has made night and day for you so that at night you may take rest and   during the day   you may seek His Bounty   sustenance   and so that you may become grateful  
Then if the mother and the father both desire with mutual consultation and consent to wean   even before the fixed two years   there will be no sin on them  
It has been   inscribed   on al   Lawh al   Mahfuz   the Preserved Tablet   before this  
And when We make the people relish   Our   Mercy after they are afflicted with distress   their plotting immediately begins against Our Signs   consigning Our Favour to oblivion     Say   Allah is Swift to punish intrigues   Surely the angels We have sent keep writing whatever plots you contrive  
And that He is the One Who makes self   sufficient   by providing according to needs   and He is the One Who enriches treasures   by giving surplus to the needs    
Verily he did not believe in Allah   the Lord of Majesty  
O My servants who have believed   Surely My earth is vast   so worship Me alone  
Are there daughters for Him   the Lord   and sons for you  
He is the One Who has spread out the earth for the creatures  
On the Straight Path  
And what do you know what the Nightly   discernable   Visitant is  
It is they who will be the Near Ones   to Allah    
  Their   line of action   also   resembles that of the people of Pharaoh and those before them who belied Our Revelations   So   Allah seized them because of their sins and Allah gives severe punishment  
And when a party of them said   O people of Yathrib   There is no position left for you to stay   safely     so go back   home     and a party of them began to seek permission from the Holy Prophet   to go back     saying   Our houses are lying exposed   whereas their houses were not exposed   they only wanted to escape   on this pretext    
And food that chokes the throat and most painful torment  
The   infant himself   spoke out   I am indeed a servant of Allah   He has given me the Book and has raised me as a Prophet  
Has not the news reached them of those who were before them   the people of Nuh   Noah     Ad and Thamud and the people of Ibrahim   Abraham   and the citizens of Madyan and the dwellers of the towns which were overturned   Their Messengers   too   came to them with clear Signs   but they disobeyed     So   it was not Allahs glory to wrong them   but it was they who used to wrong 
Surely he was of Our servants blessed with   perfect faith    
Sad     Only Allah and the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   know the real meaning     By the Holy Quran   full of direction and guidance  
Inquire of them   Who delivers you from the layers of the darkness of the land and the sea   When   in trouble     you supplicate Him totally prostrated and   also   in secret   If He delivers us from that   adversity   we shall surely be among the grateful  
And   the state of these hypocrites is such that in your presence   they say     We   have obeyed   your order     But when they depart from your Presence   a section of them opine at night contrary to what you have said   and indulge in intriguing consultations     And Allah is recording   all that   which they plot all night   So     O Beloved     turn away your illumined face f
And when you ask them   the pure wives   for something   ask them from behind a curtain  
And   there   came a caravan of travellers   They sent their water   drawer   So he lowered his bucket   into that well   and he exclaimed   Good news   Here is a boy   And they hid him regarding him a valuable trade item   And Allah knows well the activities they were busy doing  
So     O man of faith     do not follow the disbelievers and launch a large   scale struggle against them by means of   logic and preaching of the Quran    
And peace be upon me on the day of my birth   the day of my demise and the day I shall be raised up alive  
Yet it is you who are killing your own people and banishing a section of your own folk from their homeland   and   furthermore   helping   their enemies   with sin and transgression against them  
And green crops and magnificent buildings  
And     O Musa   Moses       cast your staff   on the ground     So when   Musa   Moses   after casting the staff on the ground   saw it moving fast as if it were a serpent   he   reacting naturally   turned back running and did not   even   look back     Allah said     O Musa   Moses     do not fear   Surely the Messengers do not fear in My Presence  
On that Day people will tread on behind the caller and there will be no deviation in   following   him   And all voices will be hushed due to the Majesty of the Most Kind   Lord     So you will not hear anything except a faint sound of a stir  
And you simply do not have the ability to do   ideal   justice amongst your   more than one   wives   however ardently you may desire to do it   Do not   therefore   incline with absolute fondness   towards one   thus   leaving the other like something suspended   in the midst     But if you mend your ways and refrain   from injustice and maltreatment     Allah is Most Forgiving  
Indeed We put mountains under his command which   joining him   used to glorify Me evening and morning  
  Now   do not make excuses   You have certainly become disbelievers after   showing that   you believed   If We forgive a party of you     even then   We shall torment the other party because they sinned  
Is he who walks in prone position more rightly guided or he who walks upright on a straight path  
Say   O People of the Book   why do you hinder him from Allahs path who has embraced faith   You want to make their path crooked too while you are yourselves a witness   that it is straight     And Allah is not unaware of your doings  
So   Allah paid them the reward of this world and also an excellent recompense in the Hereafter   And Allah loves   those   righteous people   who are in love with Him alone    
If you disbelieve then surely Allah is Self   Sufficient and He does not like disbelief   and ingratitude   for His servants and if you give thanks     so   He likes it for you   And no bearer of burden will bear the burden of any other   Then you have to return to your Lord   Then He will inform you of the deeds which you used to do   Surely He knows best   even   the secrets of 
And do not touch her with evil   intention   or the torment of a   gravely   terrible Day will seize you  
And surely those before them   also   denied   But how   awful did prove   My denial  
And indeed Allah took a firm promise from the Children of Israel and We appointed among them twelve chieftains   for its fulfilment   enforcement and protection     And Allah said   to the Children of Israel     I am with you   i   e   My special support and reinforcement will escort you     If you establish Prayer and pay Zakat   the Alms   due   consistently   and   always   adh
The place of refuge and repose that Day will be with your Lord alone  
And if Allah afflicts you with some distress   then there is none who can remove it but He   And if He intends any good for you   then there is none who can repel His Bounty   He bestows His Bounty upon whomsoever of His servants He pleases   And He is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
Thus Allah explains His Verses   clearly   for the people so that they may embrace piety  
So We avenged Ourselves on them   as well   and both these   towns still exist   on the highway  
Until when they will see that torment which is being promised to them     then   they will come to know who is weaker in helpers and fewer in numbers  
Allah intends to lighten your burden   And man has been created weak   and infirm    
So he whom Allah intends to give guidance   by way of bounty     He broadens his breast for Islam and he for whom He wills persistence in error   which he has purchased   He     by way of justice     tightens his breast with   such a   fierce constriction as if he were ascending up hard into the sky   i   e   height     In the same way Allah sends torment   of disgrace   upon thos
And   as for   the brothers of these satans   they draw them deeper into error   by whispering suspicions   and do not slacken   in promoting mischief and bloodshed    
And   also recall   Ismail   Ishmael     and Idris and Dhul   Kifl   They were all steadfast men of patience  
And obey Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and do not quarrel among yourselves lest   growing disunited and weak   you become timid and your impact   power   loses ground   before your enemy     So be steadfast   Surely Allah is with those who are steadfast  
Has he turned all the gods into one God   That is indeed a very strange thing  
Verily   it has been revealed to us that the torment will come upon   every   such person that rejects   the Messenger   and turns away from him  
And Paradise will be brought close to the pious   it will not be distant at all  
And how many a town   is such as   We destroyed   Our torment came upon them either at night or   while   they were asleep at noon  
Indeed   this   Quran   is the Word   communicated   by a glorious and most venerable Messenger  
And they   disbelievers   worship besides Allah those   idols   that can neither bring them any profit nor do them any harm   And the disbeliever is   always   a helper   of Satan   in   disobeying   his Lord  
He Who created me and He is the One Who guides me  
The disbelievers from among the People of the Book and the idolaters would not desist   from disbelief   until clear proof came to them  
  Musa   Moses     submitted   My Lord   I have no control   over anyone   except for myself and my brother   Harun   Aaron       So put us apart from   these   wicked people   by Your Command    
On that Day man will flee from his brother  
Have you not seen that Allah sent down water from the sky   Then We brought forth with that the fruits which have different colours   And similarly in the mountains there are white and red streaks with a variety of shades and there are deep black   streaks   as well  
Alif   Lam   Ra     Only Allah and the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   know the real meaning   This   is   that   Book whose Verses are firmly founded   then they have been explained in detail by   the Lord   Who is All   Wise   All   Aware  
  And they differed also   because of mere jealousy and malice among themselves  
And We did not create them   the Prophets   with such bodies as would not eat food   nor were they to live   their visible life in the world   forever  
So they set off whispering   to one another  
Glorify the Name of your Lord   the Most High  
Then   except a few   all the rest of you turned back   from the promise     and you are but averse   to the Truth    
  Have come forth   by the hands of emissaries   and scribes    
And We made his offspring the only survivors  
And do they not know that Allah gives abundantly to whom He wills and sparingly   to whom He wills     Surely in that are Signs for those who   truly   believe  
Indeed those who have embraced faith and have emigrated   for the cause of Allah   and have fought in the way of Allah with their material as well as human resources   and those who have provided   the immigrants   with shelter and helped   them     it is they who are real friends of one another   And those who have believed   but   have not emigrated   for Allah   you do not owe 
And nor the living and the dead can be alike   Surely Allah makes him hear whom He wills   and it is not your responsibility to make those hear who are   buried   in the graves   i   e   you are not responsible to make the disbelievers accept what you say    
And nothing prevented the people from embracing faith and imploring forgiveness from their Lord   while guidance had reached them   except   waiting for   the pattern of the ancients   destruction   occurring to them or that the torment should come in front of them  
And whoever repents and executes good   so he returns to Allah   the way   returning is due  
  O servant of Allah     The roaming about of the disbelievers in the cities   with luxurious riches   should not cause you any illusion  
And Musa   Moses   said   My Lord knows best the one who has brought Guidance from Him and   also   the one for whom the House of the Hereafter will be the   best   end   Surely the wrongdoers will not prosper  
  These   accursed people   who spread false rumours   promote hatred   strife and terrorism and denigrate the Holy Messenger and his family     wherever found   are to be seized and mercilessly killed by way of target killing  
So they who believe and do good deeds   for them is forgiveness and bounty of   greater   honour and dignity  
O Prophet     Say to the Muslims     When you seek to divorce your women   divorce them during their period of purity and count their prescribed period   And keep fearing Allah   Who is your Lord   And do not drive them out of their homes nor should they leave unless they commit open indecency   And these are Allahs   fixed   limits   And whoever transgresses Allahs limits has sur
And He is the One Who sends the winds as glad tidings before His Mercy   rain   until when these   winds   bring moisture   laden heavy clouds   We drive these   clouds   towards a town dead   of drought and infertility     Then We cause downpour from   the clouds     and by means of this   water   We bring forth fruits of all kinds   from the earth     In like manner We shall bri
He said   O Lord   then grant me respite till the Day   when   people will be raised up   again    
Who had set up another god besides Allah   So hurl him into fierce torment  
And indeed Allah has revealed to you this   Command   in the Book that when you hear Allahs Revelations being denied and ridiculed   do not sit in their company until they engage in some other discourse   renouncing the denial and ridicule     Otherwise you too will become like them   Surely Allah will assemble the hypocrites and the disbelievers together in Hell  
When the most wretched of them stood up  
And by those things that you do not see  
Then surely   O strayed people   deniers  
It is they for whom a special provision is appointed   morning and evening    
Then they   all   will forgather suddenly in the open expanse   for assembly    
And     O Beloved     had not Allahs Bounty and Mercy been upon you   a party of these   treacherous   people had resolved to lead you astray whereas they are only leading themselves astray and can no way do any harm to you   And Allah has revealed to you the Book and Wisdom and has bestowed upon you all that knowledge which you did not possess   Mighty indeed is Allahs Bounty on 
So the inmates of Hell have to eat of it alone and have to fill their bellies with the same  
And   have We not given him   a tongue and two lips  
Indeed only he who is purified   from the afflictions of his ill   commanding self and pollution of sins   will triumph  
And the Day when the Last Hour is established   the evildoers will lose hope  
So I have warned you of the raging Fire   of Hell    
And We would have surely guided them to the straight path  
Then We placed him as a sperm drop   zygote   in a secure place   mothers womb    
This will be their feast on the Day of Resurrection  
As for the boat   that belonged to some poor people who used to toil for wages on the river   So I decided to make it defective   because   a   cruel   king was   standing   ahead of them   snatching every   undamaged   boat by force   from the owners without any compensation    
Surely in this   incident   there is a great Sign and most of them were not the believers  
The truth is that whoever you like   to bring on to the path of guidance   you do not yourself bring him on to the path of guidance   Instead     it so happens that   whoever Allah pleases He makes him tread the path of guidance   through your mediation     And He knows best those who find the path of guidance  
And granted him affluence   in sources of luxury    
And We have not sent any Messenger but that he must be obeyed by the Command of Allah   And     O Beloved     if they   having wronged their souls   had come to you imploring the forgiveness of Allah and the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   had also asked forgiveness for them   then   owing to this mediation and intercession   they would certainly have found Allah Mos
So glorify Allah when you enter the evening   Maghrib and Isha times   and when you enter the morning   Fajr time    
But when We would remove from them the torment for the appointed term which they nearly completed   they would at once break their promise  
And their predecessors will say to their successors   You have not gained any superiority over us   so you   too   taste the torment   now   for what you used to earn  
And We made from among them authorities and leaders who kept disseminating guidance by Our Command when they persevered with patience   And they believed in Our Revelations with certitude  
Musa   Moses   prayed   O my Lord   expand my breast for me  
Then after them We sent Musa   Moses   with Our Signs to Pharaoh and the nobles of his   court     but they did injustice to   these Proofs and Miracles     See   then   what was the end of those who spread mischief and strife  
And   moreover   create fear in those who say that Allah has taken a son   for Himself    
And turning to one another   they will mutually question  
And when you heard of this   heinous charge     why did you not declare   at the same moment     It is not   at all justified   for us to talk about it     Rather you should have said   O Allah     Holy are You   High above making such a woman the beloved wife of Your beloved and Esteemed Messenger     This is a grave charge  
Say   Allah has proclaimed the Truth   so follow the Din   Religion   of Ibrahim   Abraham   who   rejecting every evil   devoted himself wholly to Allah   And he was not one of the polytheists  
Do they not know that he who opposes Allah and His Messenger   the Fire of Hell is   destined   for him wherein he will live forever   There is no humiliation greater than this  
  O disbelievers     You have indeed brought most horrible and unusual evil   on your tongues    
The Day when the heaven will shake with a terrible tremor  
So that by means of this   downpour   We bring forth   from the earth   grain and vegetation  
Have you not seen that Allah has subjected to you whatever is in the earth and   also   the vessels that sail in the sea   and river   by His Command   i   e   Law   and He withholds the heavens   spatial spheres and atmospheric fields   from falling on to the earth   under a cosmic system     But   when He wills   they will collide   by His Command   Surely Allah is Most Compassi
And those who disbelieve and reject Our Revelations   for them will be humiliating punishment  
Allah has not made for any man two hearts inside his breast chamber   nor has He made your wives your mothers whom you call mothers by way of Zihar   a form of divorce     Nor He has made your adopted sons your   real   sons   These are merely the utterances of your mouth   And Allah says the Truth and He alone shows the   straight   path  
If We intend   We should send down upon them   such   a Sign from heaven as their necks would not but bow down before it  
You make the night enter into the day and You make the day enter into the night and You bring the living out of the dead and You bring the dead out of the living and You bless   with Your Bounties   without measure whom You wish  
And if We intend We drown them   Then   there will not be any to respond to their cry   nor will they be saved anyway  
Most Blessed is the Name of your Lord   the Master of Glory and Splendour and the Master of Bounty and Honour  
Then He   the Lord of Honour   drew closer   to His Beloved Muhammad   blessings and peace be upon him       and then drew even closer  
Say   Tell me   if this   Quran   is from Allah and you deny it and a witness from the Children of Israel   also   bears testimony to the mention of   the revelation of   such a Book   in the Revealed Books revealed earlier     then he believes   in it as well   but   despite that   you show arrogance     then what will be your fate     Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing p
Then   turning away   from the Truth     he launched struggle   in rivalry against Musa   Moses      
And We helped them   so it was they who overmastered  
And seek   Allahs   help through patience and Prayer   But this is no doubt hard except for the humble   whose hearts have been softened with the Love of Allah and gripped with His Fear    
The Revelation of this Book is from Allah   Almighty   All   Knowing  
And relate to them   also   the news about the guests of Ibrahim   Abraham    
As for the people of Ad   they were unrightfully arrogant   and rebellious   in the land and said   Who is greater in might than we are   And have they not seen that Allah   Who has created them   is far mightier in power than they are   And they kept denying Our Revelations  
So bring back our ancestors   alive   if you are truthful  
Say   Should all men and jinn join in the attempt to produce   some other book   the like of this Quran     even   then they will not be able to produce the like thereof   though they may become supporters to one another  
Indeed the Godfearing will   rejoice   in gardens and streams  
When he said to his father   i   e   uncle   and his people   What idols are these   whose worship   you are stuck to   squatting  
  The dead will be raised up again   so that He makes evident   the Truth   wherein they disagree and that the disbelievers may realize that they alone are in fact liars  
  It implies   every heavenly body   may it be a star   a planet or any one of the heavenly spheres   which shines and brightens   the space    
And   even   from his wife and his children  
There   they will take the cups   of holy drink   by grabbing   This   holy drink of Paradise   will be free of foolish talk and sinful acts  
They said   If the wolf devours him while we   a strong party   too are   present   then we are as good as nothing  
So by means of deceit he tempted both of them down   into eating the fruit of the tree     When both had tasted   the fruit of   the tree   their private parts became manifest to them and they started sticking the leaves of Paradise to their   bodies     Then their Lord called out to them   Did I not forbid both of you   to get closer to   that tree and did I   not   say to you th
  O My Esteemed Beloved     Not so indeed   These   Verses of the Holy Quran   are but advice  
Then his Lord exalted him and   placed him   among the perfectly pious     blessing him with His exceptional nearness    
  It will be said to him     Read your book   of deeds     Today you yourself are enough for examining your own account  
  Said for the education of the Umma   the Community       And     supposing the impossible     if you follow their desires after that knowledge which has come to you   from Allah   then there will not be any friend or helper for you to protect you from Allah  
And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah   and making a false claim of Prophethood   says   Revelation has been sent down to me   whereas no revelation is sent to him     And who can be more unjust than one who   making a false claim of being a god   says   I   too   shall soon send down such   a Book   as Allah has sent   And if you visualize   the sight   
And Allah knows what you hide and what you show  
In fact Allah lifted him up towards Himself   in heaven   and Allah is Almighty   Most Wise  
They said   We are powerful and great warriors but the command is your prerogative   So consider   yourself   what command you should give  
Neither their wealth nor their children will ever be able to save them from   the punishment of   Allah   It is they who are the inmates of Hell   They will live in it forever  
Beware   If he does not desist   from the denigration of the Holy Prophet and antagonism against the true Din   Religion       We shall certainly grab his forehead and drag him by the forelock  
  The one who   hinders pious works very much and is a miser   rebellious transgressor   and   toughened sinner  
Surely those who fabricated the accusation   against Aisha the truthful   the pure   the chaste may Allah be well pleased with her   were   also   a party from among you   Do not consider this   slander account   as a bad thing for you   It has rather   turned out to be   good for you   Everyone of them has a share in the sin as much as he has earned it   but whoever has had major
And when Our enlightening Verses are recited to the disbelievers   you can clearly see   signs of   displeasure   and resentment   on their faces   It seems as if they are nearly ready for violent attack on those who are reciting to them Our Signs   Say     O restlessly upset disbelievers     shall I inform you of something more agonizing than this     That   is the Fire   of Hell
And verily your Lord alone is Almighty   Ever   Merciful indeed  
They said   Have you come to us to turn us away from our gods   So bring us that   torment   you are threatening us with   if you are of those who speak the truth  
Those who listen attentively to what is said   then follow the best in it   it is they whom Allah has given guidance and it is they who have wisdom  
  It will be said   Yes     this is the same Day of Judgment which you used to reject  
And those who believed and did pious deeds     Allah   shall reward them in full   And Allah does not like the wrongdoers  
Enter it   Then it is all the same for you whether you observe patience or you do not observe patience   You will be paid only for those deeds which you used to do  
You are only a Warner  
He alone has created man from a drop of vital fluid   yet he has become openly contentious   instead of becoming totally submissive to Allah    
And   the disbelievers   say   Why this   Prophet   does not bring us any Sign from his Lord   Has there not come to them   the Quran     a Clear Proof of the things   mentioned   in the former Books  
And indeed he is quite stubborn in his love of wealth  
  But   those who were sure that   after martyrdom or death   they were going to meet Allah said   Many a time a small party has overcome a   very   large party by the Command of Allah   And Allah awards His companionship to the steadfast  
They   satans   cannot listen to the celestial world   And   burning brands   are thrown on them from every side  
And that it is upon Him alone to raise up alive   also after death    
So the Command of our Lord has been proved against us     Now   we are about to taste   the torment    
Who gives his wealth away   in the cause of Allah   to attain to purity   of his soul and assets    
And We awarded   all of   them Our   special   Mercy and put their praise and admiration on high rhetoric   among the believers of every divine religion    
They exclaimed   By Allah   Allah has certainly exalted you above us   and certainly we alone were the sinners  
What   When we are dead and turned to dust and bones   shall we be certainly raised   alive again    
Certainly not   Surely We have created them from a substance which they   also   know  
Indeed before you   too   the Messengers were laughed at   but then the same   torment of the Truth   which they ridiculed besieged those of them who ridiculed  
For what crime was she slain  
And     O mankind     there is no moving   animal   on the earth nor a bird that flies on its two wings but   such   that they are species like you   umamun amthalu   kum in several traits     We have not omitted anything   which is not given symbolic or elaborate details   in the Book   Then all   the people   shall be gathered before their Lord  
And   also   with gardens and springs  
And had We destroyed them through some calamity already   they would have said   O Lord   why did You not send to us any Messenger so that we might have followed Your Revelations before we were humiliated and disgraced  
Certainly they   also   become disbelievers who say   Allah is the third of the three   Gods     whereas there is none worthy of worship except the One God   If they do not desist from   the absurdity   which they utter   a grievous punishment will surely torment those of them who disbelieve  
Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth and poured down water from the sky and then by means of this water produced fruits for you as provision   And He has made vessels subservient to you so that they may sail in the sea by Allahs Command and He has   also   put rivers under your control  
So turn your face away from them   The Day when the caller   angel   will call towards the most detestable thing   the expanse of the last assembly    
So leave them   Let them remain indulged in vain talk and absurd sport until they meet the Day which they are being promised  
Say   Neither can anyone shelter me from a torment   against the command   of Allah   nor can I ever find refuge apart from Him alone  
And have they not seen that We have made the Sanctuary   of the Kaba   a safe haven while people are abducted from all around them   Do they   still   believe in falsehood and will they continue disregarding the favour of Allah  
That is because Allah alone is the Truth and those whom these people worship besides Allah are false and that Allah is Most High   the Supreme  
Then   after eating   surely they will return to Hell   again    
And you will not be given   any   reward but for what you used to do  
Have you not seen that to Allah bows in prostration   the whole creation   that is in the heavens and in the earth   and the sun   and the moon and the stars   and the mountains   and the vegetable as well as the animal kingdoms and many of mankind   too     But there are still many   human beings   for whom the torment has been proved   due to their disbelief and polytheism     A
So We did not find in that town   any house   of the Muslims except one   in which were the Prophet Lut   Lot   and his two daughters    
And if Allah willed   He could deprive them absolutely of hearing and sight  
And Yusuf   Joseph   said to the one whom he believed to be released   Mention me to your king     he may thus recall that another innocent one is also lying in imprisonment     But Satan made him forget to mention   him   to his king and consequently Yusuf   Joseph   remained in prison for several years  
And He is the One Who has subjected sea   rivers and oceans   as well   in addition to air and land   so that you may eat fresh   and favourite   seafood from there and may take out from them gems   etc     that you wear as ornaments   And     O man     you see the vessels   and ships   that pierce through the water   of the rivers and oceans     And   all this has been managed   
Then when she   the Queen   came she was asked   Is your throne like this   She said   It looks as if it is the same and we have already known   the Truth of Sulaimans   Solomons   Prophethood   and we have become Muslims  
No indeed   There is no place of refuge  
And do not kill your children due to fear of poverty   We alone provide for them and for you   as well     Indeed killing them is a major sin  
And advance fast towards forgiveness from your Lord and Paradise whose vastness encompasses the heavens and the earth   and   which has been prepared for the pious  
Which will never be decreased for them and they will be lying there in endless despair  
And so that those who have been given   true   knowledge may know that the   Revelation which the Messenger recited   is   based on   the truth from your Lord   so   they believe in the same   and reject Satans suggestions   and their hearts beat in submissiveness   before the Lord     No doubt   Allah does guide the believers to the straight path  
And the mountains will be crumbled into bits  
  Allah   will say   In like manner Our Signs came to you   in the world   but you forgot them and the same way you   too   will be forgotten today  
Have you seen him who has turned away   from the Truth    
And when it is said to them   Bow down   before Allah     they do not bow  
And it is no joke  
Had Allah willed to beget children   for Himself     He would have chosen whom He liked out of His Creation   Glory be to Him   He is Allah   the One   the All   Dominant  
  Call to mind the time   when the brothers of Yusuf   Joseph   said   Certainly Yusuf   Joseph   and his brother are dearer to our father than we are whereas we are a stronger party   comprising ten members     No doubt our father is lost into an evident ecstasy   resulting from deep love for them    
Then he who will have done even an atoms weight of good will see it  
He   Allah   knows what is before them and what is behind them   and they do not intercede   before His Presence   but for him with whom He is pleased   And they remain fearful of His Awe and Magnificence  
So   whoever fabricates a lie against Allah even after this   then it is they who are the wrongdoers  
See how they lie against their own selves and the blame they used to fabricate   in the world   has vanished from them  
The high   scale jolt rocking   the whole universe of the heavens and the earth   and thunder  
And when the she   camels heavy with young will be left neglected and discarded   i   e   no one will tend them    
And if Allah were to seize people   by torment   for the   evil   deeds which they have earned   He would not spare any moving creature on the surface of the earth   But He is giving them respite till an appointed time   Then when their appointed time comes   Allah is Ever   Vigilant of His servants  
  O servant     When you see them   their bodies   and height and structure   seem attractive to you   and if they speak   you lend ear to what they say   i   e   they will look sensible to you but the fact is that   they are nothing but wooden bars propped up against a supporting wall   They take every loud voice   as some suffering and misery   befallen them   It is these   hypo

So the People of Ibrahim   Abraham   had no answer except that they said   Kill him or burn him   Then Allah delivered him from the fire   of Nimrod     Surely there are Signs in this incident for those who have believed  
So when you are to fight   for the elimination of militancy and terrorism   against the   warring   disbelievers   in the battlefield     strike their necks   while fighting because they took innocent human lives and destroyed peace by their terrorist activities   till   when you have killed a good many of them   in the battle     then tie   the remaining prisoners   tightly   The
Have you thought of it   how   wondrous a Sign of the Signs   of Our Might   were the people of the Kahf and the Raqim   i   e   the people of Cave and the Cave Tablet or the Raqim valley    
Are they waiting for   the bad days   similar to those of the people who have passed away before them   Say   Wait   then     I am   also   with you among those who wait  
And do they not follow each others Qibla among themselves  
That was a community which has passed   For them is what they earned and for you is what you will earn   And you will not be asked about their deeds  
Surely   they were such people that when it was said to them   There is no worthy of worship except Allah   they used to show arrogance  
And the Jews and the Christians say   We are the sons of Allah and His beloved ones   Say     If your statement is correct   then why does He punish you for your sins   Rather   the truth is that   of all   the Creation   Allah has brought into being   you   too   are   but   a human being   i   e   just like other human species     He forgives whom He pleases and chastises whom H
And   O my people   let not your enmity and hostility against me so incite you   due to which   there comes upon you that   torment   that befell the people of Nuh   Noah     or the people of Hud   or the people of Salih   And   the days of   the people of Lut   Lot   have not anyway passed far before you  
He had nearly turned us away from our gods   had we not held fast to their   worship     And when they see the torment   they will soon realize who was astray  
Have you sent it down from the cloud or are We its Sender  
Then We caused the wind to obey him   It used to blow gently under his command wherever he would desire   it   to go  
Then   Salih   turned away from them   saying   O my people   verily I delivered to you the message of my Lord and gave you advice   as well   but you do not like the counsellors  
Indeed those who believe and do pious deeds   We certainly do not waste his reward who does pious deeds
