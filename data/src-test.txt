And which of our acts has annoyed you   Just that we have believed in the   true   Signs of our Lord when they reached us   O our Lord   Gush on us torrents of patience and lift us   from the world   as   steadfast   Muslims  
Say   O you ignoramuses   do you ask me to worship someone other than Allah  
and when darkness covers them   they stand still  
If We intended to take up some sport   We would adopt it on Our own if at all We were to do   so    
And let not the disbelievers ever assume that they have escaped   safe and sound     Assuredly they can never make   Us   powerless  
Yet they had not been sent to watch over their   state of affairs    
The one who listens to the Revelations of Allah that are recited to him   then insists   on his disbelief   arrogantly as if he did not hear them   give him the news of a grievous torment  
These   polytheists   worship merely the feminine objects apart from Allah   and they worship only Satan   the rebel  
And mention Our servant Ayyub   Job   when he cried to his Lord   Satan has afflicted me with great torture and suffering  
But becomes miserly when he receives good fortune   or affluence    
And whoever closes his eyes to the remembrance of the Most Kind   Lord     We appoint a Satan to dominate him and stick to him all the time  
The likeness of His Light   which is glowing in the world in the form of Muhammads Light   is as a niche   like   sacred breast   wherein is glowing the lamp   of Prophethood    
Ask the Children of Israel how many a Clear Sign We gave them   But he who alters Allahs Bounty after it has reached him then Allah surely inflicts severe torment  
And     O Jibrail   Gabriel     say to My Beloved     We cannot descend   onto earth   without the Command of your Lord   To Him belongs whatever is before us and whatever is behind us and whatever is in between   And your Lord is never forgetful   of you    
Surely the torment of your Lord will certainly take place  
  They   are the people who believe and   always   remain Godfearing   committed to piety  
And will never be able to absent themselves from it   Hell    
He is the One Who gives life and causes death   Then when He decides upon a thing He says to it only   Be   so it becomes  
They submitted   We have put trust in Allah alone   O our Lord   make us not a victim of the oppressors injustice  
And     O party of jinn     those men also thought just as you thought that Allah would never raise up anyone   after death    
Then ultimately We took retribution from them   for all their disobedience and breach of promises   and drowned them in the river because they   successively   belied Our Revelations and were   absolutely   neglectful of them  
  O Muslims     Do you also want to ask your Messenger   blessing and peace be upon him   questions the way Musa   Moses   was asked before   So he who changes belief for disbelief   for sure   loses the right path  
So those who belie their meeting with Allah incur loss   so much so that when the Last Hour comes upon them all of a sudden they will say   Oh   woe to us   We committed a   serious   blunder with regard to   believing in   this   Day of Resurrection     And they will be carrying the burdens   of their sins   on their backs   Beware   Most evil is that burden which they are bearin
Until when death comes to anyone of them     then   he will say   O my Lord   send me back   to the world    
Permission   to fight against mischief   disruption and oppression   is granted to those against whom   unjust   war is waged   because they were oppressed and Allah is doubtlessly All   Powerful to help them   the oppressed    
And he seated his parents on the throne and they   all   fell down prostrate before Yusuf   Joseph   and Yusuf   Joseph   said   O father   this is the interpretation of   that   dream of mine which I had seen   long   before     To most of the commentators it took forty years     And my Lord has surely proved it true   And indeed He did me a   great   favour when He took me out o
O Believers   Indeed the majority of the priests and monks   of the People of the Book   devour the wealth of the people through unfair   means   and hinder from the path of Allah   i   e   fill their safes with peoples money and hinder it from being spent for the publicity and promotion of the True Din   Religion       And those who hoard silver and gold and do not spend it in th
Surely those who offend Allah and His Prophet   Allah curses them in the world and in the Hereafter and He has prepared for them a disgraceful torment  
On that Day   We shall present Hell before the disbelievers fully exposed  
And you will be divided into three classes  
Then We split the earth and tear it asunder  
And whatever   wealth and comforts   have been given to you is a small benefit for   a few days   worldly life   and what is with Allah is better and everlasting   And   that   is for those who believe and put trust in their Lord  
There is no sin on the aged   weak   and the sick   nor on those who are not so   affluent   that they may spend while they are most sincerely and truly devoted to Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     No way can the righteous   i   e   the spiritually excellent   be blamed and Allah is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
And indeed We sent Musa   Moses   with Our Signs     O Musa   Moses       bring your people out of darkness to the light and remind them of the Days of Allah   which had come upon them and their preceding generations     Surely there are Signs in it for those who are highly steadfast   and   deeply grateful  
To Him alone belong the keys of the heavens and the earth and those who disbelieve in the Revelations of Allah   it is they who are the losers  
And if We make him taste   some   favour after the suffering that afflicted him   then he is sure to say   Gone are all my troubles   Surely   he   becomes   most exultant and boastful  
And this is a mighty oath if you realize  
And certainly We have sent down to you luminous Signs and none but the disobedient can deny them  
Surely We have put iron collars round their necks reaching their chins   So they have raised their heads up  
If you ardently desire them to take the path of guidance then   let not your sanctified disposition be overburdened     for indeed Allah does not guide him whom He holds strayed   nor do they have any helpers  
They will certainly carry their own burdens   of sins   and   will also have loaded   many   other   burdens   over themselves   along with their own burdens   And they will certainly be interrogated on the Day of Resurrection about those   false allegations   which they used to invent  
Allah is He apart from Whom there is no God     the Real   King   the Most Pure of all shortcomings   Perfectly Free from all imperfections   and the Bestower of Peace     the Giver of security and protection   and the Attester of the Messengers by means of Miracles     the Guardian and Watchful   the Almighty and the Lord of Honour   the Lord of Great Majesty   the Supreme Author
  Even then   they will certainly say   this     Our eyes have been hypnotized   through some magic trick and deceit     rather we are spellbound  
Do they say that this   Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     has invented a lie against Allah   So if Allah wills   He may set a seal   of patience and steadfastness   on your holy heart   so that their absurd talk may not hurt you     And Allah eliminates falsehood and maintains the Truth proved   i   e   established   by His Words   Surely   He knows best the secrets 
So   enter the gates of Hell   You are its permanent residents   So how evil is the abode of the arrogant  
And the herbs spread over the earth and all   species of   the trees prostrate themselves   to Him alone    
Woe to the deniers on that Day  
And you do not ask for any reward from them for this   communicating and preaching the Message     This Quran is but a reminder to all mankind  
  The angels said     O Ibrahim   Abraham     leave off this   matter     Surely the Command of   torment from   your Lord has now come to pass   and the torment is about to seize them which cannot be averted  
Woe to the deniers on that Day  
  He is   the Knower of the unseen   So He does not inform any   common man   of His unseen  
And the witnesses should not refuse whenever they are called   for evidence     And do not be weary of writing it down for its term whether the transaction is small or large  
  The magicians   said   Musa   Moses     Either you throw   your object   or we become   the first   to throw  
And no friend will enquire after his friend  
And He is the One Who spread out the earth   despite its being round   and brought about mountains and rivers in it and produced pairs of   genders   two each among all kinds of fruits   as well   He is the One Who   stretches the cover of the night over the day   Indeed there are   many   Signs in it for those who meditate  
Nuh   Noah   submitted   O my Lord   I seek refuge with You from asking You that of which I have no knowledge   And if You forgive me not and bestow   not   mercy on me   then   I shall be of the losers  
And surely We have repeatedly explained for people every sort of example in this Quran   in diverse ways     but most people have not accepted   it   This is nothing   but sheer ingratitude  
These are the   hypocrite and vicious   people that Allah knows best every secret of their hearts   So   avoid them and admonish them persistently and establish effective communication with them about themselves  
  Even   the Greatest Horror   of the Day of Rising   will not grieve them and the angels will welcome them     saying     This is   but   your Day which you were promised  
So have they not pondered over this Command   of Allah     Or has there come to them such a thing that did not come to their fathers  
So We granted his prayer and We delivered him from grief   And likewise We always deliver the believers  
That Day no man or jinn will be asked about his sin  
And that essentially it is only Our army that is going to dominate  
And   call to mind the time   when Musa   Moses   said to his people   Recall   that   blessing of Allah conferred upon you when He delivered you from the people of Pharaoh who used to afflict you with severe torment   slaying your male children and sparing the female ones   And in it was a great trial for you from your Lord  
I will certainly award him severe punishment   for being absent without leave   or will certainly slaughter him   or he will bring me a sound plea   of being not guilty    
  Nor do they consider   how has the earth been spread out   besides its round shape    
Then We emancipated him and those who were on his side by Our Mercy and cut the roots of those who denied Our Revelations   And they were those who would never have believed  
He said   I bewail my worry and grief to Allah alone   and I know from Allah what you do not know  
And   the idolaters   worship   apart from Allah   those   idols   which can neither harm nor benefit them and   in justification of their false worship   they say   These   idols   are our intercessors with Allah   Say   Do you seek to inform Allah of the   fabricated   presumption   of intercession by idols   whose   existence   He is not aware of either in the heavens or on in 
And   also remember   Dhun   Nun   the Prophet whom fish swallowed   when he went away enraged   at his people     So he thought that We would not cause him any distress   during that journey     Then he cried out   entangled   in   the layers of   the darkness   of night   under the river and in the fish belly     There is no God except You   Glory be to You   Surely I was of tho
He is the Most Forgiving   the Most Loving  
So when Musa   Moses   completed the appointed term and set out with his wife   he saw a fire in the direction of Tur     That was a flash of Absolute Beauty which caught his heart and fascinated him     He said to his wife   Stay   here     I have seen a fire   I may bring you some news   about Him   from that   fire in Whose pursuit I have long been wandering     or   I may brin
And if you want to punish   then punish only   as severely   as you were afflicted   but if you remain patient then certainly that is better for those who keep patience  
Say   to them     Had I had that   torment   which you desire to have in haste then certainly the matter between me and you would have been settled once for all   And Allah knows the unjust full well  
And     seeing this disgust   the polytheist   followers will say   Would that we could get a chance   to return to the world     then we   too   would turn our backs on them as they have done to us   today     In this way Allah will show them their own deeds as remorse and regret   And   no way   shall they be able to escape from Hell  
He Who has created death and life   so that   He may test you as to which of you is best in conduct   And He is Almighty   Most Forgiving  
But the unjust among them substituted some other statement for that which they were told   So We sent upon them torment from heaven because they were engaged in injustice and wickedness  
Direct the believing men to keep their eyes always lowered and guard their private parts   That is purer for them   Surely Allah is Well Aware of the   works   which they are busy doing  
Surely   nothing is hidden from Allah in the earth or in the heaven  
And who can be a greater wrongdoer than the one who fabricates a lie against Allah   Such people will be brought before their Lord and the witnesses will say   These are the ones who foisted a lie upon their Lord   Know that Allahs curse is upon the wrongdoers
This is a concession and kindness from your Lord   So   anyone who transgresses after that   for him there is painful torment  
Say     Yes   even though   be you stones or iron  
Allah keeps the believers firm   footed in the life of this world as well as in the Hereafter with   the blessing   of this Firm Word   but Allah holds the wrongdoers astray   And Allah puts into action whatever He wills  
And had Allah not written exile for them He would have tormented them   more severely   in the world   And there is for them the punishment of Hell in the Hereafter   as well    
All those blessings which they will long for will be there for them in that   Paradise   and there is still another blessing with Us   or much more   so the lovers will be enchanted    
And when We took from you   this   solemn covenant   as well     You shall not shed one anothers blood   among yourselves   nor shall you expel your people   from their homes and townships     Then you agreed   to implement it   and you   also   bear witness   to it    
And appoint for me a minister from my family  
And do not say about those who are slain in the cause of Allah that they are dead     They are not dead     They are rather alive but you have no perception   of their life    
And if We give Him a taste of Mercy from Us after that misery which touched him   he surely starts saying   This is my privilege   And I do not think that the Last Hour will ever take place   And if at all I am returned to my Lord even then there will surely be good fortune for me in His Presence   So We will certainly inform the disbelievers of the deeds which they did and We sha
And surely My curse is on you till the Day of Resurrection  
  O Beloved     Tell My servants   I am Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
Rise and stand   in Prayer   at night but   for   a short while  
Then Musa   Moses   cast down his staff which     changing into a serpent     began swallowing up those things which they had made look different   from reality   through trickery  
And you see that the sun   when it rises   moves to the right from their cave and inclines obliquely from them to the left when it sets while they are   lying   in the open chamber of the cave   This   change of the suns course   is one of the   great   Signs of Allahs   Might     He whom Allah guides is the one who is rightly guided   but one whom He holds strayed you will not fi
So Today you have no authority over profit or loss of one another   And We shall say to the wrongdoers   Savour the taste of the torment of Hell that you used to belie  
They will be amid fierce hot wind of Hell and simmering water  
They said   We will solicit his father in connection with sending him and we will certainly do   it    
When their   kinship   brother Nuh   Noah   said to them   Do you not fear   Allah    
And those who have believed and have done pious deeds   it is they who are the inhabitants of Paradise   They shall live there forever  
And if they dispute with you then say   Allah knows best whatever you are doing  
And when some adversity afflicts you in the sea   then   all   those   idols   disappear   from your minds   you keep worshipping apart from Him   Allah Whom you remember at that time     Then when He rescues you and takes you safe ashore   you once again   start turning away   from Him     And man has happened to be extremely thankless  
The Messengers who were Bearers of good news and Warners   were sent   so that after   the arrival of these   Messengers people may not have any plea against Allah   And Allah is Almighty   Most Wise  
That you may warn the people whose fathers were   also   not warned   So they are careless and neglectful  
And We did not send Messengers before you but   that   they certainly ate food and also walked about in the marketplaces   as needed     And We have made you a trial for one another   Will you observe patience   in trial     And your Lord is All   Seeing  
And indeed We gave Musa   Moses   the Book so that they might take guidance  
And those who strived in   opposition to   Our Revelations presuming to frustrate   Us     it is they for whom there is punishment of a highly agonizing torment  
Whoever is on the earth will perish  
  The fore   mentioned fai materials   are   also   for the poor emigrants who are driven out of their houses and possessions   and properties     They seek Allahs bounty and His favour and pleasure   And they help Allah and His Messenger     blessings and peace be upon him   by sacrificing their possessions and homeland     It is they who are true believers  
And   these   are the people who pray   all the time before the Presence of Allah     O our Lord   turn away from us the torment of Hell   Surely its torment is most injurious   and everlasting    
And when We bestow a favour upon man he turns his face away and   keeping withdrawn   strides far from Us   And when distress touches him he entreats lengthy prayers  
Allah said   Catch it and do not fear   We shall transform it to its former state just now  
If We so intend We would crumble it to pieces   Then you would only be struck with awe and shame  
A shadow which is neither cool nor protecting against the heat of fire  
Apart from Allah   They will say   They have been lost from us   In fact we never worshipped anything before   That is how Allah holds the disbelievers astray  
And by this He leaves in error only those who are   already   disobedient  
So no doubt this   Quran   is direction and guidance for the Godfearing  
And We have not granted eternity to any human being before you   in the physical life of the world     So   if you pass away   from here   will they live forever  
  That   will destroy everything by the command of its Lord   They were   destroyed   in such a way that nothing could be seen except their   ruined   houses   That is how We punish the evildoers  
The believers are only those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     and when they are with you for some   collective   issue which brings   the people   together   then they should not go away from there   i   e   they should participate whole   heartedly to work for collective coherence and unity among the Umma   Community     until the
And truly     far   earlier than this   We had given a strict command to Adam but he forgot   And We did not observe in him any intention   to disobey   at all   it was just an omission    
Repel evil in such a way as is best of all   We know best   the things   they say  
And that He is the One Who has created the two genders   male and female  
And his close companion   angel   will say   That is what I have ready   for you    
He is the One Who is the First   of all   and the Last   of all     And He is Manifest   as for His Power   and Hidden   as goes His Essence     And He knows everything full well  
And the   favourite   servants of the Most Kind   Lord   are those who walk gently on the earth and when the ignorant   i   e   impolite   people say to them something   unlikable   they   get aside   saying   Peace  
We know best what they will be saying while one of them better in wisdom and deeds will say   You have not stayed   in the world   for more than a day  
He   Allah   Who is watching the conduct of every soul and   these idols that the disbelievers   have made peers to Allah   can they be alike   No way     Say     Just   name them     You fools     Do you inform Him   Allah   of something whose   existence   He does not know in the whole earth   Or is it all   mere   superficial talk   which has no contact with reality     Rather 
Then they belied him   So We delivered him and those who were with him in the Ark and We drowned all those who rejected Our Revelations as false   They were indeed a blind people   with no insight    
And surely We made   the ruins of the Deluge   subsist as a Sign   So is there anyone who will think   and take advice    
And the Word of your Lord has been perfected in truthfulness and justice   There is no one who can change His Words   And He is All   Hearing   All   Knowing  
And these are the examples which We explain for the people   to understand     and none understands them except those who have knowledge  
And keep fighting against them until the disruption and mischief is totally eliminated and Din   the complete system of life and submission   practically becomes subservient to Allah alone   But if they desist   then offensive action is not permissible except against the wrongdoers  
Neither your   disbelieving and polytheist   kindred nor your   disbelieving and polytheist   children will be of any good to you on the Day of Resurrection     On that Day Allah will   bring about complete separation between you     the believers will be sent to Paradise and the disbelievers to Hell     And Allah observes your doings well  
And   call to mind the time   when We said to the angels   Fall down in prostration before Adam   Then all prostrated themselves except Iblis   Satan     He said   Shall I prostrate myself before him whom You have created of clay  
And whatever they did is   recorded   in   their   Books of Deeds  
That is how We infuse this   mockery and ridicule   into the hearts of the sinners  
  It will be said to them     This is the Fire of Hell you used to belie  
And some among the Jews pervert the words   of the Torah   from their   root   places and say   We have heard but we disobey   and   also say     Listen     God forbid     May you not be listened to   and twisting their tongues   scoffing at Din   Religion   they say   Raina   And     instead     if they had said   We have heard and obeyed   and   Your Eminence   Please   give aud
The angels who are bearing the Throne and those who are around it     all   glorify their Lord with His praise and believe in Him and pray for forgiveness of the believers   and submit     O our Lord   You encompass everything in   Your   Mercy and Knowledge   So forgive those who turn to You in repentance and follow Your path and protect them from the torment of Hell  
Do not let any pauper come near you in the garden today  
And when Our Revelations are recited to them they say   Of course   we have heard   If we desire   we can also compose Verses analogous to that   Word     These are   nothing   but the   imaginary   tales of the ancients  
And that He is the One Who makes one laugh   granting delight   and makes one weep   granting grief    
And no one can die without Allahs Command     His   term has been fixed in writing   And whoever desires the reward of this world   We give him of that   and whoever longs for the reward of the Hereafter   We give him of that   and soon shall We pay reward   affluently   to those who pay thanks  
About which they differ  
And when We substitute some Verse in place of another Verse   and Allah   alone   knows best whatever He sends down     then   the disbelievers say   You are but a forger   But most of them do not know   the rationale of sending down and substituting the verses    
So that   the battle of Badr   might establish   through this great victory   the Truth as Truth and falsehood as false   even though the wicked might dislike   this decisiveness of the armed conflict between the forces of Truth and falsehood    
And has the news of the contenders reached you when they jumped over the wall and entered the chamber of worship   of Dawud   David      
And no Prophet came to them but they used to make fun of him  
Say to My servants who have believed that they must establish Prayer and spend   in Our Way   both secretly and openly of the provision that We have granted them before the dawn of the Day when neither any transaction will take place nor any   worldly   friendship   will profit    
And if you ask these   disbelievers     Who created the heavens and the earth and made the sun and the moon law   abiding   they shall certainly say   Allah   Then where are they turning away  
And if you err even after Our clear Signs have come to you   then bear in mind that Allah is All   Mighty   All   Wise  
They   the hypocrites   will call out those   believers     saying   Were we not in your company   in the world     They will say   Yes indeed   But you troubled yourselves with the disruption   of hypocrisy   and used to wait   for our woe and destruction     And you doubted   the Prophethood of Muhammad   blessings and peace be upon him   and Din   Religion of Islam     and your
Then We determined time periods   for all the stages of growth from conception to birth     And how excellent do We determine  
Indeed those who reject Our Revelations as false and rebel against them   the gates of the heavens   of Mercy and Acceptance   shall not be opened to them   nor will they be able to enter Paradise until the camel passes through the eye of a needle   i   e   their entrance into Paradise will be impossible the same way     And it is like that We punish the evildoers  
With the exception of his wife   We have decided that she shall certainly be among those who stay back   to become the victims of the torment    
Then We drove them   Pharaohs people   out of gardens and springs  
That Day Gabriel   the Spirit of Peace and Security   and   all   angels will stand in ranks   none able to speak except he whom the Most Kind Lord would already have awarded sanction   to intercede   and who also said the right thing     in keeping with the teachings of Islam   during his life of the world    
And when his Lord commanded him   Bow down   before Me     he submitted   I bow down before the Lord of all the worlds  
And the inhabitants of Madyan   too belied     And Musa   Moses   was also rejected   So I kept giving respite to   all   the disbelievers   Ultimately I seized them     Say     how terrible was My punishment  
And among these   hypocrites   are also   some   who made a promise with Allah   If He bestows upon us   riches   out of His Bounty   we shall certainly give alms   in His Way   and become of the righteous  
When you were saying to the believers   Is it not enough for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand sent   down angels  
Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day will not seek from you   this   permission that they should   not   fight with their possessions and lives   And Allah knows the Godfearing full well  
So bear their   heart   rending   talk patiently and glorify your Lord with His praise before the rising of the sun   in Fajr   dawn   Prayer   and before its setting   in the Asr   afternoon   Prayer   and glorify Him in the early hours of night   the Maghrib   sunset   and Isha   evening   Prayer   and also at the ends of the day   in Zuhr   midday   Prayer when the first half o
Surely   Allah has bought from the believers their souls and wealth in return for Paradise for them     Now   they fight in the way of Allah   So they kill   for the Truth   and are slain   themselves too   Allah has taken   the firm promise as a bountiful obligation on Him in the Torah   the Gospel   the Injil   and the Quran   And who is truer to his promise than Allah   So     
And if both   husband and wife   end up in separation   Allah will make each of them independent   of the other   out of His Own Abundance and Allah is All   Embracing   Most Wise  
Shall We   deprive   the obedient like the disobedient  
  O Esteemed Beloved     Recite that Book which has been revealed to you and establish Prayer   Surely Prayer prohibits indecency and impiety   and verily the remembrance of Allah is the greatest   And Allah knows whatever   deeds   you do  
So let not someone who   himself   does not believe in it and follows his own lust   of the lower self   prevent you from   focusing   it   otherwise you   too   will perish  
  O My Esteemed Beloved     By   your   father   Adam or Ibrahim   Abraham     and by those who are born  
O Believers   Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for the people before you so that you may become pious  
O our Lord   And admit them to the Gardens of Eden   for eternal living   You have promised them   And   with them admit also   the pious ones of their fathers and their wives and their children   Surely You are Almighty   Most Wise  
And those who disbelieve and belie Our Revelations and the Meeting of the Last Day   it is they who will be brought forth to the torment  
That is not at all   the case     rather   the fact is that the evil deeds   which they earned have rusted their hearts     The Revelations   therefore   do not move their hearts    
So it happened   We made another people the inheritors of all that  
Will plunge into the Blazing Fire  
And     O people     he who blesses you with his   holy   companionship   Muhammad   Allah bless him and give him peace     is not mad     Whatever he communicates is the Truth    
Then cast him into Hell  
The only saying of the believers   when they are called to Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   in order that he may judge between them   is that they say   We have heard and we   totally   submit to obey   It is they who will prosper  
And indeed We have made the Quran easy for direction and guidance   but is there anyone who will take advice  
And you   will wonder   if you see   the spectacle   when the angels take away the souls of the disbelievers   They continue striking their faces and backs   with hammers   and say     Taste the torment of the Fire   of Hell    
And   surely   We shall reduce it to a barren land   perishing all   that is on   the surface of the earth    
So that We make this   episode a reminding   lesson of warning for you and that the retentive ears may retain it  
Corruption and disorder has spread over land and sea on account of   the sins   which people have earned with their hands so that Allah may make them taste the outcome of some of their   evil   deeds that they have committed in order that they may desist  
Glory be to Him Who created everything in pairs of those the earth grows and of themselves as well and     moreover     of the things they do not know  
So prostrate yourselves before Allah and worship   Him    
They will live in it forever   They will find neither any caring friend nor any supporting helper  
In which are   written   correct and firm Commandments  
Then     O you doomed     where are you going   disregarding such a valuable treasure    
And when it is said to them   Spend   in the way of Allah   of what Allah has given you   the disbelievers say to the believers   Shall we feed that   poor   man whom   if Allah so willed   He would feed   Himself     You are but   caught   in clear error  
And when the decision will have been given   Satan will say   Indeed Allah gave you a true promise   and I   also   promised you something   so I have violated the promise   And I had no authority over you   in the world   except that I called you   towards falsehood     So you accepted my call   for your own interest     Now do not blame me but blame your   own   selves   I can d
And in like manner We have revealed this   Quran   as a Commandment in the Arabic language   And     O listener     if you follow the desires of these   disbelievers   after the   conclusive   knowledge has reached you   then there is no helper or protector for you against Allah  
There is no sin on those who believe and do righteous deeds with regard to what they have eaten   of the unlawful things before the Command of Prohibitions came     whereas   in all other matters   they were Godwary and put firm faith   in other Commandments of Allah     and practised pious deeds consistently   Later     also after the Revelation of the Prohibitions     they desis
And We have not created the heavens and the earth and   the Creation   that is between them but with wisdom and   fixing of   the appointed term   And those who have disbelieved turn away from what they have been warned of  
And   these   are the people who are neither extravagant nor miserly when they spend   And their spending is   based on   a balance between the two extremes   of extravagance and miserliness    
  O Glorious Messenger     That is some of the news We are relating to you of   those   towns some of which still exist and   some   were totally annihilated  
Then why did those   idols   not come to their aid which they had taken as gods besides Allah for attaining   His   nearness   But in fact they   false gods   were lost from them   And this   setting up false gods   was their lie   And   it was   this fabrication that they used to weave  
And these are the people who submit   before the Presence of Allah     O our Lord   grant us coolness of eyes in our wives and our children   and make us leaders of the Godfearing people  
It was only for a little while that he stayed   outside     then he   appeared and   said   I have come to know a thing that is   perhaps   not in your knowledge   and I have brought you from   the land of   Saba   Sheba   a sure and true piece of news  
They will spontaneously say     All   this belongs to Allah   Say   Why do you not fear then  
Should they belie you then say   Your Lord is the Lord of Infinite Mercy   but His torment will not be averted from the evildoers  
And your Lord has said   Always pray to Me   I shall certainly grant your prayer   Surely those who turn away from My worship in defiance will soon enter Hell disgraced  
And indeed We have made whatever is on earth a means of its beauty   and adornment   so that We test   the inhabitants of the earth   as to who is better on merit of their deeds  
Whoever adopts the path of guidance follows it to his own benefit and whoever goes astray   then evil consequences of his error also fall back on him alone   And no bearer of burden will bear the burden   of the sins   of any other   And We do not torment   any people   at all until We send a Messenger   to them    
Should you be in a state of fear   then   do offer Prayer   whether on foot or while riding   as the case may be     but once you get back to peace   remember Allah in the manner He has taught you which you did not know   before    
And We subjected those   cattle   to them   So some of them are their riding animals   and they eat some of them  
For them there will be clouds of fire   as covers   over them and pavements of fire beneath them too   This is   the torment   with which Allah warns His servants   O My servants   Always fear Me  
He surely knows what you utter loudly and also knows   all   that you keep secret  
  The magicians   said   O Musa   Moses     either you cast   your thing   or we become the first ones to cast  
For Allah alone is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth   He creates what He likes   He blesses with girls whom He wills and blesses with boys whom He wills  
O community of jinn and men   Did Messengers not come to you from among yourselves reciting My Verses to you and warning you of your appearance   before Me   this Day   They will say   We bear witness against our own souls   The life of the world had caught them in deception and they will bear witness   to this effect   against themselves that   in the world   they were disbelieve
To Allah alone belongs the sovereignty of all the heavens and the earth and to Him shall all return  
There is not even an iota of doubt in it that sending down of this Book is from the Lord of all the worlds  
But those who have done injustice follow the desires of their   ill   commanding   selves without any knowledge   and guidance     So who can guide him whom Allah has held astray   And there are no helpers for them  
What is the matter with you   How do you make a judgment  
And he who had embraced faith said   O my people   I fear   the torment of   an evil day coming upon you   too   like the day that seized   the former   generations  
  Which is   on an Unfolded Scroll  
The dwellers of al   Aika   i   e   the People of the Wood also   rejected the Messengers  
This is the Day of Truth   So   whoever longs may obtain an abode   of mercy and nearness   in the Presence of his Lord  
And when those   hypocrites   come to you   they say   We have believed   while they entered   your company   with disbelief and left with the same   disbelief     And Allah knows best   the matters   which they carry hidden  
Musa   Moses   said   Do you utter   such remarks   about the Truth when it has come to you     Apply your reason and use vision and see   if it is sorcery   And the sorcerers will never be able to prosper  
When the earth will be violently shaken with a high   scale quake  
And   remember   Ibrahim   Abraham   when he said to his people   Worship Allah and fear Him   That is better for you if you know   the reality    
Say   It has been revealed to me that a party of the jinn listened to   my recitation   carefully and then   went back to their people and   said   Surely we have heard a wonderful Quran  
Then   when Our Command   of torment   came to pass   We saved Salih and the believers with him through Our Mercy and   also delivered them   from the humiliation of that day   Surely your Lord alone is Powerful   Sovereign  
And beside them will be   sitting chaste women   with downcast looks and wide beautiful eyes  
And the mountains like   flakes of   coloured wool  
And fear that Day when no soul shall be able to pay any compensation on behalf of another  
And to the people of Ad   We sent   their   kinship   brother Hud   He said   O my people   worship Allah   You have no God other than Him   You merely invent a lie against Allah   of having a partner    
Then   even   after this your hearts hardened   So   in hardness   they   have become   like stones or even harder  
A compensation commensurate with   their revolt    
Then their Lord accorded approval to their supplication   and said     Certainly I do not waste wages of any labourer whether man or woman   you all are from one another   So those who have emigrated   for the cause of Allah   and have been driven out of their dwellings   for Him alone   and have been offended in My way   and fought for My sake and were slain   I shall verily eras
So have they not seen those   Signs   in the heaven and the earth   which have beset them   from their front and from their rear   If We so intend We would sink them into the earth or let a part of the sky fall upon them   Verily there is in it a Sign for every servant of Allah who turns to Him  
And when they see some Sign   they mock it  
There are   for them multiple   degrees of higher grades from Him and Forgiveness and Mercy   And Allah is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
Always fill up full measure and do not become injurious   to the rights of the people    
  This time   they said   Pray for us to your Lord that He may make clear to us what exact type of cow it is   because   the cow has become doubtful to us   and if Allah so wills   we shall indeed be guided aright  
Did He not thwart their crafty designs  
And there was   also   no party for him to come to his help against Allah   nor was he himself able to avenge   this destruction    
Who   besides that   taught man   all that   which he did not know  
So I swear by the things that you see  
When he said to his people   Do you not fear   Allah    
And that man   according to justice   will get only that for which he will have strived     As for Bounty   no one has any right to it   That is merely Allahs bestowal and pleasure   granting as much as He wills to whom He may please    
And fear that Day when no soul shall be able to recompense anything on behalf of another   nor shall any ransom be accepted from him   to deliver himself     nor shall any intercession benefit him   without Allahs permission   and nor shall they be helped   against the Command of Allah    
  It will be said to them     O My   intimate   servants   there is no fear for you this Day   nor shall you grieve  
And do not rebel against Allah   I have come to you with the enlightening proof  
No one can touch it except the purified   cleansed   ones  
And   moreover   owing to their rejection of faith and uttering against Maryam   Mary   a grave calumny  
And when he arrived at the watering   well   of Madyan   he found there a crowd of people watering   their flocks     And on a side he saw two women   withdrawn   holding back   their goats   Musa   Moses     asked   Why are you   standing   in this condition   Both said   We cannot water   our goats   till the shepherds take back their flocks and our father is an aged man  
Except boiling water and suppurated fluid oozing   from the wounds of the inmates of Hell    
He among you who talks in a low voice and the other who talks in a loud voice   and he who is hidden in   the darkness of   the night and he who moves about in the day   light     all are alike   to Him    
  O Glorious Beloved     By your   sacred   life   surely these people   too   are wandering astray   possessed by their lust   like the people of Lut   Lot      
And evaluate and test the orphans   for the sake of their training   till they attain to   the age of   marriage   Then if you discern in them ingenuity   and the knack of planning     hand over their assets to them   And devour not their wealth spending it wastefully and in haste   fearing that after   they grow mature   they will take it back     The one who is affluent must abs
Indeed those who disbelieve from among the People of the Book and the polytheists   all   will be   abiding   in the Fire of Hell   They are its permanent dwellers   It is they who are the worst of the Creation  
Ibrahim   Abraham   said   You are giving me the glad tidings at a time when old age has already overtaken me   So what good news are you giving me now  
And you can escape   from Allah   neither in the earth nor in the heavens   and nor is there for you any guardian or helper except Allah  
The Last Hour has drawn near and the moon has split into two  
And indeed We sent Nuh   Noah   to his people   He lived among them for a millennium less fifty years   Then the Great Flood   Deluge   seized them while they were wrongdoers  
  O Esteemed Beloved     Thus We communicate to you news about the   communities   who have passed away   and We have surely given you from Our Exclusive Presence the Reminder   i   e   an Admonishing Book    
And   O my people   keep working in your place   I am doing my work   Soon will you come to know whom that torment seizes which will humiliate him   and who it is that is a liar   And wait on and I   too   wait along with you  
And they seek from you torment in haste and Allah never goes against His promise   And   when the Hour of torment will come   then one day   of torment   with your Lord is like a thousand years   according to your   scale of   counting  
  Allah   said   O Iblis   what has happened to you that you have not joined those who have prostrated themselves  
And surely your Lord is Gracious to the people but most of them do not give thanks  
And to   the people of   Ad We   sent   their   kinship   brother Hud   He said   O my people   always worship Allah   you have no other God except He   Will you not become Godfearing  
And then We too would have bestowed upon them a great reward from Our Presence  
That is how the judgment of your Lord is proved true against the defiant that they will not believe  
And do not agree with any vile   most mean swearer of oaths  
Is there a disease   of hypocrisy   in their hearts   Or do they doubt   the majesty and glory of the Messenger     Or do they fear that Allah and His Messenger will do them wrong     Nay     they themselves are the wrongdoers  
Have they been created by nothing or are they themselves the creators  
Except for him on whom your Lord has bestowed His Mercy and that is what He has created them for   And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled   Surely I will fill Hell with all the   disbelieving   jinn and men  
And   similarly   this can avert punishment from that   woman as well   if she   herself   gives evidence   swearing four times by Allah that he   the husband   is a liar   in accusing her    
Will you not fight a people who broke their oaths and decided to banish the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   while the first time it is they who triggered against you   war and violation of the agreement     Do you fear them   But Allah has more right that you should fear Him   provided you are believers  
Say   Have you seen your partner   gods you worship apart from Allah   Show me what they have created of the earth   Or do they have any share in   the creation of   the heavens   Or have We given them any Book so that they stick to its evidence     Nothing at all     In fact the wrongdoers promise one another nothing but deception  
They will be neither exhausted nor restricted   to eat    
Surely We sent down this   Holy Quran   during the Night of Destiny  
O Believers   Obey Allah and obey the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and those   men of Truth   who hold command among you   Then if you disagree among yourselves over any issue   refer it to Allah and the Messenger     blessings and peace be upon him   for final judgment   if you believe in Allah and the Last Day   That is best   for you   and best for the end resu
And surely We gave Musa   Moses   the Book   the Torah   and sent   many   Messengers after him in succession  
Say   Are you waiting for simply one of the two good fortunes in our favour   i   e   victory or martyrdom   whether we are martyred or return victorious     And we are waiting in your favour   in view of your hypocrisy   to see Allah afflict you with   special   torment either from Himself or at our hands   So wait   We   too   are waiting with you   to see whose wait comes out t
Inaudibly whispering to one another   You stayed in the world for hardly ten days  
He   Pharaoh   said   If you have brought a Sign then bring it   to the fore   if you are truthful  
I do not ask for any sustenance   i   e   earning   from them   nor do I require that they should feed Me  
This is the Truth that the record of the evildoers is kept in Sijjin   the ante   chamber of Hell    
And when suffering afflicts people they call upon their Lord turning towards Him   but when He delights them with the taste of Mercy from Him then some of them straight away start setting up partners with their Lord  
And these are   the people of   Ad who denied the Revelations of their Lord and disobeyed their Messengers and followed the dictates of every oppressive   and arrogant   enemy of the Truth  
Then He accepted your repentance  
  Khidr   said   Did I not tell you that you would not be able to restrain yourself in my company  
And verily your Lord will judge between these   believers and disbelievers   by His Command   of Justice     And He is Almighty   All   Knowing  
Then even after this Allah accepts repentance of the one He wills   i   e   He blesses him with an aptness for Islam and His Merciful Eye     And Allah is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
It may well be that   after this   your Lord will have mercy on you   but if you revert to the same   rebellious and defiant behaviour     then We too will get back to the same   tormenting once again     And We have made Hell a prison for the disbelievers  
  Allah   will say   How many years have you stayed in the earth  
We said   Fire   be cool and become absolute safety for Ibrahim   Abraham    
Well   Who has created the heavens and the earth and poured down water for you from the atmosphere in the sky   Then with that   water   We brought forth fresh and beautiful gardens   It was not possible for you to grow plants in these   gardens     Is there any   other   God besides Allah   In fact   they are the people who are turning away   from the path of Truth    
  Musa   Moses     said     He   is the Lord of the east and the west and   the whole universe   between the two if you have   some   sense  
Assuredly Ibrahim   Abraham   was indeed most forbearing   sobbing and submissive and turning to Us under all circumstances  
Then surely it is Our concern to call them to account  
And he who will have done even an atoms weight of evil will   also   see it  
Do they not see that We are persistently reducing the land   under their control   most of the areas under their rule are gradually accepting the Islamic Rule     And Allah is the One Who decrees   there is none who can undo His decree   And He is Swift in accountability  
And those who are niggardly in giving away   from the wealth   which Allah has bestowed upon them out of His bounty must never consider this miserliness of any benefit for themselves   it is rather injurious to them   Soon on the Day of Resurrection this wealth   which they are niggardly about   will be put around   their necks   like a neck   fetter   To Allah belongs the heritag
They will submit   Glory be to You   You alone are our Protector   not they   In fact they used to worship the jinn   It was in them that most of them believed  
And from wherever you move   on a journey     turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque   at the time of Prayer     And this indeed is the Truth from your Lord   and Allah is not unaware of your doings  
And He alone has created for you cattle   They are for you a source of warm clothing and   other   benefits   And you   also   eat some of them  
And We made the heavens   i   e   upper spheres of the earth   a secure roof   in order to save the inhabitants of the earth from adverse effects of fatal forces and aggressive waves shooting towards the earth from space   and they turn away from these Signs   of upper spheres    
These are the people of our community who have made many gods apart from Him   Why do they not bring any clear proof   in support of their godhood     So   who is a greater wrongdoer than he who fabricates a lie against Allah  
So Allah has been Gracious to favour us and has saved us from the punishment of the Fire of Hell  
To those of you who believe and keep doing pious deeds Allah has given the promise   whose fulfilment and implementation is obligatory for the Umma   Community       He will surely bestow upon them Khilafa   the trust of right to rule   as He granted   the right to   rule to those who were before them   And   through dominance and rule   He will strengthen and stabilize their Din 
O Believers   What is the matter with you that when you are asked to set out   to fight   in the way of Allah you   weighing heavier   bend towards   the material and ignoble world of   the earth   Are you pleased with the life of this world rather than the Hereafter   So   the property and belongings of the life of this world are worthless in   comparison with   the Hereafter   a
Those whose eyes were veiled   by negligence   against My remembrance and they could not even listen   to My remembrance    
And     O Messenger     indeed We sent before you   many   Messengers and brought up for them wives and children   as well     And that is not the role of a Messenger to bring a Sign but by Allahs Command   There is an inscription for every appointed term  
Then     O Glorious Beloved     We sent down Revelation to you   Follow Din   Religion   of Ibrahim   Abraham     who was at variance with every falsehood and was not of those who associate partners with Allah  
Alif Lam Ra   Only Allah and the Messenger know the real meaning     These are the Verses of the illumining Book  
And this was Our proof   of the Oneness of Allah   that We imparted to Ibrahim   Abraham   against a people   hostile to him     We exalt to higher ranks whom We please   Surely your Lord is Most Wise   All   Knowing  
And never say about anything   I shall do this work tomorrow  
Ain   Sin   Qaf     Only Allah and the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   know the real meaning    
Then they could neither gather strength to stand   nor could they take revenge   on Us    
And also   in their companionship will be   maidens with wide lovely eyes  
Except for His Messengers with whom He is well   pleased   and reveals to them alone the Unseen because that is an exclusive trait of Prophethood and a Messengers miracle as well     So indeed He appoints protectors at both front and rear of him   the Messenger   for the security of the knowledge of the Unseen    
But except for a few youths from his people   none   believed in Musa   Moses     owing to the fear of Pharaoh and their   tribal   chiefs and   nobles     lest they should afflict them with   some   misery   And Pharaoh was indeed a tyrant in the land   of Egypt   and a transgressor   And certainly he was amongst those who exceed limits   in oppression    
And who refuse to lend even a worthless small object of use even on demand  
Say   to them     Who provides you with sustenance from the heaven and the earth   i   e   from above and beneath     Or Who is the master of your ears and eyes   i   e   hearing and sight     And Who brings forth the living from the dead   i   e   animate from inanimate   and Who brings forth the dead from the living   i   e   inanimate from animate     And Who manages   all the 
And those who hurt the believing men and the believing women without their doing anything   wrong     surely they bear   on themselves   the burden of a false allegation and an open sin  
And that Day Hell will be brought forth   On that Day man will come to understand   but how will admonition   avail him then    
And Allah made this   form of help   merely a good news in order that your hearts are reassured thereby   And   in truth   there is no   other   help except the help from Allah   Indeed Allah alone is Almighty   Most Wise  
Out of a   sperm   drop when it is ejaculated   into the mothers womb    
And their Prophet said to them   Allah has appointed for you Talut   Saul   as a king  
Say   Who has forbidden the adornment   and beautification   of Allah that He has produced for His servants and   who has forbidden also   the pure and clean food   Say     All these bounties   that are   available generally   for the believers in the life of this world will be exclusively   for them   on the Day of Resurrection   This way We elucidate Our Revelations for those wh
O Believers   Obey Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and do not turn away from him while you are hearing  
So   now   intercession of the intercessors will not be of any benefit to them  
But whoever wrongs   then after doing evil replaces   it   with good   then I am indeed Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
But they broke the command of their Din   Religion   into sects by disagreeing among themselves   Each sect is glad with that much   portion of Din   Religion     which they have  
And He is the One Who provides me with food and drink  
And by the clouds that carry a heavy load   of water    
No discomfort will touch them nor will they be driven out from there  
Say   Do you dispute with us about Allah whereas He is   not only   our Lord but your Lord   too     And ours are our works and yours are your works   And we are truly devoted to Him alone  
Allah is He Who is the Creator   the One Who brings into existence from nothingness   i   e   the Inventor     the Bestower of Form     in short     all Beautiful Names belong to Him alone   All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Him   the Lord of Honour   the Most Wise  
Allah   Who is your Lord and the Lord of your foregoing ancestors   as well    
Indeed my Helper is Allah Who has revealed the Book and He is the One Who also protects and helps the pious  
The Day when the earth and the mountains shall shake violently and mountains will turn into heaps of flying away sand  
And on the Day of Resurrection We shall set up balances of fairness and justice   So no soul will be wronged in the least   And if there is   someones deed   equal to the weight of a mustard seed   We shall bring forth that   as well     And We are Sufficient to take account  
They will say   We were not of those who used to offer Prayers  
Beseech   I seek refuge with the Lord of   the whole of   mankind  
And the same way We made for every Prophet enemiesthe satans from among men and jinnwho always pour into one anothers hearts   flattery and   gilded talk   as suspicions   in order to deceive   And if your Lord had willed   to prevent them forcefully   they would not have done so   So leave them and   also   the falsehood which they fabricate  
No one can avert it  
They were acclimatized to the summer and winter   commercial   trips  
  O Muslims     So   if they do not accept your challenge   then firmly believe that the Quran has been revealed with Allahs knowledge   and that there is no other God but He   So   will you   now   stick to Islam   firm   footed    
So on that Day they   all   will share the torment  
Nor shall any intercession be accepted from him   of a person who shall not have Allahs permission to intercede    
whereas they shall be given fruits resembling   only in appearance    
And surely We have sent down to you evident and enlightening Revelations and some examples of those who have passed away before you   i   e   like Aishas story   the story of Maryam   Mary   and the story of Yusuf   Joseph       And   this   is for the direction and guidance of the Godfearing  
The evil of all these   mentioned   acts is most despicable to your Lord  
Then hymn Allahs praise   in gratitude     glorifying Him   and beg Him   humbly   for pardon   Surely He is Ever   Relenting and Oft   Returning   with evermore compassion    
Say   to them     To whom belongs the earth and everyone   living   in it   if you know   anything    
  During the days of famine   Yusufs   Josephs   brothers came   to Egypt to procure grain   and came to him   So Yusuf   Joseph   recognized them   but they could not recognize him  
Surely We chose them for an exclusive   characteristic of   the remembrance of the home in the Hereafter  
Then your Lord unleashed the scourge of punishment on them  
And enjoin Prayer on your family and strictly adhere to it   And We do not ask for provision from you     rather   We provide for you   And it is fearing God that brings about best results  
  O Esteemed Messenger     They ask you about the spoils of war   Say   The spoils belong to Allah and the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him     So   fear Allah and keep your mutual matters set aright   and obey Allah and His Messenger if you are believers  
Holy   free of any imperfection   weakness and insufficiency   is He Who took His   most beloved and intimate   Servant in a small portion of a night from the Sacred Mosque to the al   Aqsa Mosque   whose surroundings We have blessed   in order that We might show him   the Perfect Servant   Our Signs   Surely He is the One Who is All   Hearing   All   Seeing  
Surely the   Lord   Who has enjoined   the teaching   preaching and establishment of the system given in   the Quran upon you   He will bring you back   according to your desire   to the place of return   Makka or the Hereafter with victory and success     Say   My Lord knows best the one who brought Guidance and   also   the one who is in open error  
  Making spiritual disclosures   face to face on raised couches  
And when you travel in the land   there will be no sin on you if you shorten the Prayer   i   e   offer two instead of four mandatory cycles     if you fear that the disbelievers are likely to afflict you with distress   Assuredly   the disbelievers are your open enemies  
And indeed We sent Musa   Moses   with Our Signs and clear authority  
And that I keep reciting the Quran   So whoever accepts Guidance takes the straight path only for his own benefit and   to him   who wanders on in error   say   I am only of the Warners  
Surely   Hell is a place of ambush  
O our Lord   Verily   I have settled my offspring   Ismail   Ishmael     in the barren valley   of Makka   in the close vicinity of Your Sacred House   O our Lord   so that they may establish Prayer   So make the hearts of the people incline towards them with love and fondness   and provide for them   all kinds of   fruits as sustenance so that they may remain grateful  
And if there were a Quran by which mountains could be set in motion   or by which the earth could be split open or by which the dead could be spoken to     even then they would not believe in it     But all matters are under the Control of Allah   Have the believers not yet perceived that if Allah had so willed   He would have guided all mankind   And   some   disaster will contin
Then   when they took him along and all agreed to throw him into some deep dark well   We revealed to him     O Yusuf   Joseph     do not worry   A time will come when   you will certainly remind them of this affair of theirs and they will not have the sense   of your exalted station    
And they did not realize true appreciation and veneration of Allahs Glory as the appreciation and veneration of His Glory was due   And the whole earth will be in His grip on the Day of Resurrection and all the heavenly spheres will be rolled up in His right hand   i   e   firm hold of His Might     Holy is He and High and Exalted above all what they associate with him  
Well   are they better or the people of Tubba   the people of Asad Abu Kurib al   Hamiri   the King of Yemen   and those who were before them   We destroyed   all of   them   Surely they were people given to evildoing  
So set your   radiant   face to the straight Din   Religion   before that Day comes from Allah which will not avert   at all     On that Day people will separate from one another  
Have they not travelled and toured in the earth so that they could see the fate of those who passed before them   Allah cast upon them total destruction   There are many such calamities awaiting the disbelievers  
Ta   Sin   Mim     Only Allah and the Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   know the real meaning    
And   there will be   bird   meat as well which they   the Near Ones   will desire  
So   do   wait   Certainly they   too   are waiting     You will see the revenge and their evil end and they will see your glory and My favours to the believers through your mediation    
And they fall down on their faces sighing and wailing   and this   Quran   increases on their fear and submissiveness ever more  
Allah   alone   has created seven heavens and   brought about seven strata layer upon layer also while creating   the earth like them   And the Command   phenomenon of coordination in the system of nature   continues to operate among them so that you may know that Allah has Absolute Power over everything   and that Allah has encompassed everything with His Knowledge   i   e   when
Yusuf   Joseph   said   Allah save us from detaining someone   other   than him with whom we have found our item   Then We shall become of the unjust  
And beside them will be pure women   houris   with eyes downcast   chastity conscious   and of equal age  
Nor   can   the darkness and the light   be alike    
Allah will say   Do not dispute in My Presence while I have already sent you the warning   of punishment    
  And He has sent this Messenger for purification and education among   others of them also who have not yet joined these people   that are present now i   e   they will come after them in the time to come     And He is Almighty   Most Wise  
Musa   Moses   said   O my Lord   Forgive me and my brother and admit us to   the Embrace of   Your Mercy and You are the Most Merciful of those who show mercy  
Allah is the One Who has placed the sea under your control so that ships and vessels may sail in it by His Command   so that you may look for His bounty   i   e   sustenance through sea routes as well     and that you may become grateful   to Him    
So   have the disbelievers been rewarded in full for   the mockery   which they used to inflict upon   the believers    
Whatever is in the heavens and the earth   all   belongs to Allah alone   Surely Allah is Self   Sufficient   Worthy of all praise   by Himself    
And there is no blame on the Prophet in   accomplishing   that duty which Allah has made obligatory for him   And certainly the same has been the way and practice of Allah with those   as well   who have passed away before   And the Command of Allah is a decree which has been fulfilled  
And fear Him   Allah   Who has created you and the former generations  
And I created the jinn and human beings solely to adopt My servitude  
Do they have any god other than Allah   Glory be to Allah   above all what they set up as a partner   with Allah    
There is no compulsion in Din   Religion     Surely the guidance has been evidently distinguished from error   So he who rejects false gods and believes in Allah has grasped such a firm handhold that will never   possibly   give way   And Allah is All   Hearing   All   Knowing  
But that Day no one will be able to torment like His torment  
And ordain for us good in   the life of   this world   as well as   in the Hereafter   Surely we have turned and totally inclined towards You     Allah   said   I inflict My punishment on whom I will and My Mercy encompasses everything   So   very soon I shall prescribe this   mercy   for those who adopt Godwariness and pay Zakat   the Alms   due   regularly   and it is they who h
So is it you who create   a human being   from it or are We the Creator  
And when you are honoured with   a word of   greeting   then   in reply   greet with a better   salutation   or   at least   reciprocate   in the same words     Surely Allah takes an account of everything  
Surely You see us well   in the perspective of total scenario    
And he whom Allah guides   then he it is the rightly guided   But he whom He holds astray   you will not find for them any helper except Him   And We shall raise them on the Day of Resurrection prone   blind   dumb and deaf   Hell is their abode   Every time it abates We shall flare it more ablaze   to torment them    
So   in fondness of that station of eternal nearness to Allah   both ate the fruit of that tree   So   their private parts became exposed to them   and both began to stick to their   bodies   the leaves of   the trees in   Paradise   And Adam made a mistake   by way of omission   in   understanding   his Lords Command   So he could not achieve the aim   of eternal life in Paradise
And that   ultimately all   have to return to your Lord  
And We brought the other party   Pharaoh and his companions   closer to that place  
And the olive and the date palm  
Allah punishes them for their mockery and lets them loose   so that they meet their fate     So they are wandering blindly in their transgression  
Except for Our Mercy and   this   provision is for an appointed term  
  Lut   Lot     said   No doubt I am of those who are disgusted by your practice  
Woe to you   when dying     then woe to you   in the grave    
And He Who has brought into existence creatures of all kinds and made for you ships and vessels and the cattle you ride   on sea as well as on land    
Say   I worship only my Lord and do not associate any partner with Him  
Then He made from the same sperm drop two genders   male and female  
Say   It is not far from possible that a part of that   torment   which you seek to hasten has nearly reached you  
Say   If in the sight of Allah the dwelling in the Hereafter is reserved for you alone and not for others   then long for death   without any fear   if   you presume   you are truthful  
Say   Surely   I fear the Day of a mighty torment if I disobey my Lord     How is it possible    
Do you wonder that direction and guidance from your Lord has come   on the tongue   of a man from among yourselves so that he may warn you   of the chastisement of Allah     And call to mind when He made you the successors   in the land   after the people of Nuh   Noah   and in raising you amply augmented your power   might and stature     So remember the Favours of Allah so that 
Then We placed it in a secure place   i   e   the mothers womb    
No indeed   But   the truth is that after you gain honour and good fortune   you do not give honour and care to orphans  
And what have you thought of the steep ascent   of the rigours of the Din   Religion   of Truth    
The angels said   Are you wondering at Allahs Command   O people of the house     showered   upon you are Mercy and Blessings of Allah   Indeed He   is   Praiseworthy   Glorious  
  In this way   Allah holds many astray and guides many aright with the same example  
And     O Beloved     when you are   present   among these   soldiers     form up for them   congregational   Prayer   A squad of them   retaining their arms   should   first   stand by you   to follow you in Prayer     having performed their prostrations   they should     getting aside     take position in your rear   And   now   another squad who has not   yet   prayed should co
And We are nearer to him   the dying one   than you but you do not see   Us    
And it will be said   to them     Call your   self   made   partners   So they will call them but they   partners   will not respond to them and those people will see the torment   Would that they had taken guidance   in the world    
Then after this We said to the Children of Israel   Settle in this land   Then when the promise of the Hereafter comes to pass We shall take you all mustered together  
You are the best community brought forth for   the guidance of   mankind   you command righteousness   forbid evil and believe in Allah   Had the People of the Book also embraced faith that would certainly have been in their favour   There are some among them who believe   while the majority of them are disobedient  
Then We revealed to him   Build an Ark under Our supervision according to Our Command   So when Our Command   for torment   comes and the   water   filled   oven starts overflowing   load into it of every kind of animals two pairs each   male and female   and also your family except that one among them about whom the Command   of torment   has already been issued   And also do not
O Believers   Why do you say what you do not do  
Verily   you are about to taste the painful torment  
Say   If your water sinks far deep into the earth   i   e   dries up   then who will bring you flowing water   on earth    
But those whose hearts are diseased   this   Sura   has added vileness   and impurity   to their filth   disbelief and hypocrisy     And they died as disbelievers  
Surely he led me astray from the direction and guidance after it had come to me   and Satan leaves man helpless and forlorn   in the time of distress    
Has man not seen that We have created him from a sperm drop   Even then   he has become an open adversary  
O People of the Book   Exceed not the limits in your Din   Religion   and speak nothing but the truth about Allahs glory   The fact is simple that the Messiah   Isa son of Maryam   Jesus son of Mary     is Allahs Messenger and His Word which He conveyed to Maryam   Mary   and a Spirit from Him   So believe in Allah and His Messengers and do not say   There are three   Gods     Ref
And I do not demand of you any wages for this   preaching of the Truth     My reward is only with the Lord of all the worlds  
Assuredly Satan is your enemy   so you too keep treating him as an enemy   being his adversary     He calls his party only to make them join the inmates of Hell  
Then   carrying   the baby in her lap     she came to her people   They said   O Maryam   Mary     surely you have brought quite an amazing thing  
So     O Beloved     fight in the cause of Allah   You will not be held responsible   for anyone else   but your own soul   And motivate the believers   for fighting     It will be no wonder if Allah smashes the attacking power of the disbelievers   And Allah is Strongest in hold as well as Hardest in punishment  
And indeed We bestowed on Dawud   David   a tremendous favour from Our Presence   and ordained     O mountains   join him in chanting melodious tunes   of Our glory and praise     And   We gave the same command   to the birds as well   making them subservient     And We made iron soft for him  
Certainly those who have disbelieved   neither their riches nor their children will provide them any protection against   the torment of   Allah   And they are the ones who are the inmates of Hell and will live there forever  
And whatever good you do Allah knows it well  
Say   He   Allah   has sent down this   Quran   Who knows all the secrets   present   in the heavens and the earth   Surely He is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful  
So I swear by the places where different portions of the Quran descend   on the Arab Messenger    
They   still   imagine that the disbelievers troops have not yet gone   back     and if those troops should come   again   they would wish them join villagers settling as nomads and   conduct surveillance to   collect news about you   And even if they were among you they would not fight except a very few  
  Allah   said   We have indeed put your people in trial after you   came away   and Samiri has led them astray  
And you were not   present at that time   on the western side   of Tur   when We sent the Command   of Prophethood   towards Musa   Moses     nor were you among   those seventy people who were   witnesses   to the Revelation to Musa   Moses     So what else is this narration except the news of the Unseen    
And We have appointed only angels as guards of Hell  
These are the people of the Right Hand   the privileged and the pardoned    
And   skilled   in stone   carving     you carve out houses in the mountains  
And if their disinclination and turning away is distressing you   and you ardently desire them to believe in any case   then   if possible   manage a tunnel     going down   into the earth   or seek some ladder     climbing up   to heaven   and bring them some   exceptional   Sign   to show them   even then they will not believe     And if Allah so willed   He would indeed assembl
So We sent upon them an appalling violent wind during ill   omened days to make them taste the torment of humiliation in the worldly life and the torment of the Hereafter will be far more degrading   And they will not be helped at all  
So when fear disappeared from Ibrahim   Abraham   and the glad tidings reached him   he disputed   with   Our   angels   about the people of Lut   Lot    
For the Day of Judgment  
Have they taken   idols as   intercessors against Allahs leave   Say   Even though they do not own anything   nor do they have any reason  
Then Pharaohs family picked him up   from the river   so that   by the will of Allah   he proves for them an enemy and   a cause of   grief   Surely Pharaoh   Haman and their armies were the evildoers  
When Lut   Lot     their   kinship   brother   said to them   Do you not fear   Allah    
And if after making promise they break their oaths and taunt you with sarcasm in your Din   Religion     then wage war against   those   chieftains of disbelief   Surely their oaths are not worth any regard   so that they desist   from their mischief   mongering    
So we led you astray   Surely we ourselves had gone astray  
Then if he   who died   was of the Near Ones  
And He has given you everything that you asked Him for and if you seek to number the Favours of Allah   you will not be able to count them all   Indeed Man is highly unjust and extremely ungrateful  
Say   I do not know whether that   Day of Rising   which is being promised to you is near or my Lord has appointed a longer term for that  
Postponing and deferring   the sacred months   is just an addition to disbelief   By this the disbelievers are led astray   they   in one year   count it lawful and in another year regard it forbidden to complete the count   of the months   which Allah has made sacred and   also   make that   month   lawful which Allah has declared unlawful   Their evil deeds have been made attrac
Then he said   This   Quran   is nothing but magic which is being transmitted from the past   magicians    
O Children of Adam   Dress up decently every time you offer Prayer   And eat and drink but do not spend extravagantly because certainly He does not like the extravagant  
Say   Whether you hide what is in your breasts or make it known   Allah knows it and He thoroughly knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth   And Allah has Mighty Control over everything  
So what is the matter with the disbelievers that they are coming towards you running  
Surely those who turned back   to disbelief   after the guidance had become clear to them   Satan   by fraud   made   turning back to disbelief   look good to them and gave them false hope of living long   in the world    
When those   angels   came to him they wished him peace   Ibrahim   Abraham   also said   in reply     Peace   be upon you       and thought in his mind that   they were strangers  
So We gave him the good news of a very forbearing son   Ismail   Ishmael      
Beyond   their current term of life     there is Hell   And   the worldly riches   which they have earned will be of no use to them   Nor will those idols be   of any benefit   that they have made guardians instead of Allah   And there is a very severe torment for them  
Let   Allahs   woe   curse   be to him   How he schemed  
And surely We know those who lived before you and We also do know those who will come after you  
Indeed your Lord alone is the Creator of all things   All   Knowing  
Indeed your enemy will remain childless and his race will be cut off  
And surely We have created the heavens and the earth and that   universe   which is between the two in six periods and no fatigue has touched Us  
The imminent   Hour of Judgment   has drawn near  
Have you not seen those who argue about the Revelations of Allah   Where are they straying  
But   so is   man that when his Lord tests him   by providing him pleasure and comfort   and honours him and gives him bounties   he says   My Lord has honoured me  
And by this city of peace   Makka    
  The people of   Lut   Lot   also rejected the Messengers  
Indeed they   the disbelievers   are hatching plots  
Surely the creation of the heavens and the earth is far greater than the creation of mankind but most people do not know  
Then that will be the Hour when the surely Inevitable   calamity   will occur  
Surely   Allah fulfilled His promise to you when you were killing them by His command until you showed cowardice and you started disputing about the command   of the Messenger     blessings and peace be upon him     and later disobeyed   him   whereas Allah had brought that victory in your sight which you coveted   Among you were some who desired gains of this world and some other
  Allah   said   O Musa   Moses     I have exalted you and chosen you above all the people by My Messages and My conversation   So hold fast to whatever I have bestowed upon you and be among the grateful  
If   in spite of all these favours and blessings   they   still   deviate   then say   Enough for me is Allah   There is no God but He   I have reposed my trust in Him alone and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne  
Show us the straight path  
But when fighting was made obligatory for them   all of them turned away   except a few  
But the most pious shall be saved from this   Fire    
And   have We not   erected mountains raised   out of it    
Say   On the Day of Judgment the belief of disbelievers will bring them no benefit   nor will they be given any respite  
O Father   No doubt there has come to me knowledge   from the Divine Presence of Allah   which has not come to you   Follow me   I shall show you the straight path  
Certainly the nearest of the people to Ibrahim     and the most deserving   are those who have followed him   in his Din   Religion       And   they   are no other than this Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   and those who have believed   in him     And Allah is the Helper of the believers  
These are the bounds   set   by Allah   So do not draw near to them   to step over    
And We admitted them to   the Embrace of   Our Mercy   Surely they were of the pious  
And those who disbelieve and deny Our Revelations   it is they who shall be the inmates of Fire   They shall abide in it forever  
And I do not demand of you any wages for this   preaching of the Truth     My reward is only with the Lord of all the worlds  
And We gave Isa   son of Maryam     Jesus   son of Mary     as well luminous Signs and strengthened   and supported   him by means of the Holy Spirit  
And when Our deputed angels visited Lut   Lot     he felt worried on their arrival and on account of them his strength sank and he said   This is a day of great distress     The angels were extremely handsome   and Lut   Lot   was aware of the evil habit of his people   So he was perturbed at the fear of possible mischief    
O mankind   Surely We have sent down for you   such a   clothing that hides your private parts and adds   to your   aesthetic value   And   in addition to your outward clothes We have also provided you an inward dress as well and that is   the dress of Allahs fear   which   is the best     All these inner and outer attires   are the Signs of Allah so that they may take advice  
And give to the kindred their rightful due and also   give   to the needy and the wayfarer and do not exhaust   your wealth   by expending wastefully  
And surely We sent the Warners among them as well  
And you leave your wives your Lord has created for you   You are rather of those who exceed bounds   in transgression    
  These are the people   who say   O our Lord   we have surely believed   so   forgive us our sins and save us from the torment of Hell  
And a sign for them is the dead earth to which We gave life   and We brought forth from it   grain     then they eat of it  
And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and   the creation   of the moving   i   e   living   creatures which He has scattered in them   And He is also Most Powerful to assemble them   all   when He wills  
And the disbelievers say   Why has any Sign not been sent down to this   Messenger   from his Lord     O My Glorious Messenger     You are only a warner   to the disobedient of their evil consequences   and a provider of guidance to every community   of the world    
And at that moment   you do nothing but helplessly look on  
And Allah has originated   chemical genesis of   every moving creature from water   So   some of them creep on their bellies   some walk on two feet and some others on four   Allah creates what He wills   Surely Allah has Absolute Power over everything  
The King   called all the women including Zulaikha and   asked   What happened to you when you   all   attempted to seduce Yusuf   Joseph   to turn him away from righteousness     Explain what that affair was     They all   unanimously   uttered   Allah save us   We have not noticed any evil in Yusuf   Joseph     The wife of Aziz   of Egypt   Zulaikha   too   spoke   The truth has
And turn to your Lord in repentance and total submission and become thoroughly obedient to Him before the torment comes upon you   Then you will not be helped at all  
We shall   also   facilitate you   to put into practice this   easy   Law    
Say to the disbelievers   You will soon be overpowered and driven towards Hell   and that is a very evil abode  
O Believers   When you marry the believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them   i   e   had sexual intercourse with them     then no waiting period is   obligatory   on them for you which you may start counting   So give them some provision and send them off nicely extending to them excellent morality  
And   We also destroyed   Qarun   Korah     Pharaoh and Haman   And surely Musa   Moses   brought to them clear Signs and they were arrogant and violent in the land but could not escape   Our seizure    
You all cannot misguide   anyone against Allah    
We shall then relate to them from   Our   knowledge   all their   affairs   and We were not absent   from anywhere   unable somehow to monitor them    
And remember   the time   when We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh who used to afflict you with fierce torment   They used to slay your boys and spare your girls alive   And in that there was a great trial for you from your Lord  
Allah is the Creator of everything and He is Ever   Watchful over everything  
So which of your Lords blessings will you both deny  
Fleeing away from a lion  
  in these   are   many   Signs   of Allahs Power   for those who put their reason to work  
No doubt those who lived before them   also   devised plots   but Allah knocked down the edifice   of their deceptive plots   from its foundations   and the roof caved in upon them   and the torment came at them from where they never thought of  
He does not speak out of his   own   desire  
  The disbelievers martyred him   then it   was said   to him       Come     enter Paradise   He said   Alas   Would that my people knew  
He thinks that his riches will keep him alive forever  
And I follow Din   Religion   of my father and forefathers   Ibrahim   Abraham     Ishaq   Isaac     and Yaqub   Jacob     And we have no right to associate anything as a partner with Allah   This   belief in the Oneness of Allah   is a   special   bounty of Allah upon us and the people   but most people do not give thanks  
  The people of   the fierce fire which was   fed   with abundant fuel  
And   the people of   Thamud   as well     Then he did not spare   anyone of them   to survive  
So   We did   and made the Children of Israel inheritors of all   those bounties    
They are those whose hearts and whose ears and whose eyes Allah has sealed and they are the ones who are neglectful   of their end in the Hereafter    
By the   Mountain   at   Tur  
There   reclining on cushions   they will be sitting   on couches     calling   at intervals   for plenteous fine fruits and   delicious   drinks

And     O Beloved     when My servants ask you about Me     tell them     I am near   I reply the call of the supplicant whenever he calls Me out   So they should embrace My obedience and have   firm   faith in Me so that they may find the   coveted   road   leading straight to the destination

And how many a Prophet has there been who fought in the cause of Allah   A large number of devotees of Allah   Awliya   also joined them   They did not lose heart due to hardships which afflicted them in the way of Allah   They neither showed weakness nor gave in   And Allah loves those who remain steadfast  
  How   can there be a promise for the polytheists with Allah and His Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   except for those with whom you have made a treaty near the Sacred Mosque   at Hudaibiya     So as long as they remain true to   the treaty with   you   you remain true to them   Surely   Allah loves those who fear Him

Your God is One God   So those who do not believe in the Hereafter are deniers at heart and are beliers and arrogant  
  Say that we have taken on the colour from   Allahs own colour   and whose colour is better than Allahs   And we worship Him alone  
And there has been coming one Messenger for every Umma   Community     So   when their Messenger came   with clear Signs   but even then they did not believe     then judgment was made among them with justice   and exactly the same will happen on the Last Day     They will not be wronged

Go you back to your father and say   O our father   your son has surely committed theft   and consequently he has been held     And we bore witness only to what we knew   And we were no guardians of the unseen

Indeed   the torment   which you are being promised has to certainly come and you cannot thwart   Allah    
And the Jews say   Allahs hand is tied up   as if God forbid   He is niggardly     Tied up be their   own   hands and they have been cursed for what they have uttered     The truth is that   both His hands are stretched out wide open   in showering His bounties and blessings     He spends   i   e   bestows His blessings on His servants   as He desires   And     O Beloved     the  
Surely the disbelievers will be called out and addressed     Today   Allahs displeasure with you is greater than your own disgust for yourselves while you used to deny when called to believe  
Then after grief He sent down on you calm   and peace for relief   in the form of a slumber that overtook a party of you   while another party   comprising hypocrites that   was worried only about their own souls indulged in false assumptions about Allah which were   just   the assumptions of ignorance   They say   Do we too have anything   i   e   authority   in this matter   Say

Do people think that they will be released   just   on saying   We have believed   and they will not be tried  
And We have not sent any Messenger but with the language of his people so that he may make   the message of the Truth   more and more clear to them   Then Allah leads astray whom He wills and provides with guidance whom He wills   And He is Almighty   Most Wise  
And set up landmarks   to navigate during the day     And   at night as well   people find   their   way by means of the stars  
Indeed he   the disobedient man   did not fulfil that   obligatory due   which   Allah   had commanded him

And recite the account of Musa   Moses   in   this Holy   Book   Surely     getting rid of the grip of self     he had become exalted and was a Messenger and Prophet  
When Musa   Moses   saw a fire   on his way back to Egypt from Madyan     he said to his family   Stay here   I have seen a fire   or I have perceived a flash of love and cordiality in a fire     Perhaps I may bring a brand from it for you   also   or I find at that fire the guidance   which I am searching for    
And they will turn to one another enquiring well   being  
  This   is the Home of the Hereafter We have made for such people that neither seek violence and vanity nor mischief in the land   And good end is for the God   fearing

And among His Signs   as well   is that He shows you lightning to make you fear and hope and pours   rain   water from the sky   Then with that He brings the earth back to life and liveliness after it dies   Verily there are Signs in it for those who put their mind to work

Have you not seen those who have exchanged Allahs Favour   of belief   for disbelief and have lowered their people into the house of destruction  
Yes   By the moon   whose increase   decrease and disappearance is evidence    
Most of them follow only conjecture   Surely   conjecture cannot in the least substitute the Truth   Assuredly   Allah knows best what they do

  O My Adorable Beloved     What a Mercy of Allah that you are lenient with them   Had you been stern and hard   hearted   people would have deserted   scattering away from around you   So pardon them   and pray for their forgiveness   and consult them in   important   matters   But once you make up your mind   then place your trust in Allah   Surely Allah loves those who trust Hi
And make him share my task   of Messengership    
And if you call them towards guidance   they cannot   even   hear   And you see these   idols   they are sculptured in such a way   as if they were looking at you whereas they do not see   anything

And his wife   Sara   who was standing   beside   laughed   So We conveyed to his   wife   the glad tidings of the birth of Ishaq   Isaac   and beyond Ishaq of Yaqub   Jacob    
And He is the One Who accepts His servants repentance   and forgives sins   and knows what you do  
Musa   Moses   said   So   get out from here and   go away   There is for you a lifelong   punishment   that you will keep saying   to everyone     Touch   me   not     touch me not     And there is yet another promise   of punishment   for you which will not be averted at all   And look at this   self   made   god of yours to which you held fast   in worship     We will surely bu
He is the One Who has made the two seas flow that join each other  
But they wondered that a Warner had come to them from among themselves   So the disbelievers say   This is strange  
Nuh   Noah   said   Get into the Ark   in the Name of Allah will it sail and anchor   Surely my Lord is Most Forgiving   Ever   Merciful

Then his wife   Sara   came with a voice laden with wonder and frustration   patted her forehead in astonishment and said     Will   an old and barren woman   give birth to a child    
So I swear by   the heavenly spheres   which recede   after appearing    
So those who believe and do good deeds   their Lord will admit them to His Mercy   That is nothing but an evident success  
And   We also annihilated     d and Thamud and the residents of Rass and many   other   people in between  
The Messiah   son of Maryam   Mary     is   nothing   but a Messenger   neither a god nor a son of God   and nor His partner     Many Messengers have indeed preceded him and his mother was a paragon of truth   saintly person     Both   were mortal creatures as they   used to eat food     O Beloved     Observe how clearly We explain the Revelations for their   guidance   but again 
Yaqub   Jacob   said   Soon shall I pray to my Lord for forgiveness for you   Indeed He alone is Most Forgiving Ever   Merciful

And the disbelievers say to the believers   Follow our way and we shall bear   the burden of   your sins   whereas they will not bear any   burden   of their sins   Surely they are liars  
If something goes in your favour   it grieves them   but if some pain afflicts you   that pleases them   However   if you keep patience and guard yourselves against evil persistently   their deceitfulness would do you no harm   And Allah indeed has encompassed all that they are doing  
When We delivered him and the whole of his family  
Surely those who disbelieve and hinder   others   from the path of Allah and this Sacred Mosque   the Kaba   which We have made equal for all the people   there is no discrimination   in it between its inhabitants and the visitors and he who resolves in it to deviate unjustly   transgress the appointed limits and violate rights     We shall make him taste grievous torment  
And wait on   we   too   are waiting  
Of one who begs and of one who is needy but does not beg  
O our Lord   Afflict them with double torment and lay on them a mighty curse

A negotiator from among them said   Do not kill Yusuf   Joseph   and lower him down at the bottom of a dark deep well   Some traveller will pick him up and carry him away     So do this   if   at all   you are up to   something

  Shuaib   said   My Lord knows best these   frauds   which you are doing  
And We made them the leaders   of the inmates of Hell     for they used to invite   people   towards Hell   And they will not be given any help on the Day of Resurrection  
  Seeing the horrors of the Hour of Resurrection     they will say   Ah   woe to us   Who has raised us from our sleeping apartments   This   coming back to life   is the same that the Most Kind Lord promised and the Messengers spoke the Truth  
Indeed Allah conferred a great favour on the believers that He raised among them   the most eminent   Messenger   blessings and peace be upon him   from among themselves who recites to them His Revelations   purifies them and educates them on the Book and Wisdom though   before that   they were in manifest error

Peace be upon Ibrahim   Abraham    
Surely both the men and the women who give charity and those who lend a goodly loan to Allah   the   reward of charity   will be increased for them manifold   and there shall be most honourable reward for them

  Ibrahim   Abraham     said   Do they hear you when you call   them    
The one who seeks may accept it   and learn by heart

  The one who is   a slanderer   fault   finder   mischief   monger   and   backbiting the people to rouse strife  
And verily your Lord alone is Almighty   Ever   Merciful  
Allah will torment him with the greatest punishment  
Then We commanded   Strike this   dead body   with a piece of this   cow     That is how Allah restores the dead to life   or will give life to the dead on the Day of Resurrection     and shows you His Signs so that you may apply your knowledge and understanding  
It is just not conceivable about any Prophet that he would conceal anything   And whoever hides away   anothers right   will have to bring forth on the Day of Resurrection whatever he had held back   Then everyone will be paid in full for his deeds   and they will not be wronged  
Indeed Allah enjoins justice and benevolence   towards everyone     and giving away to the kindred and forbids indecency   evil deeds   defiance and disobedience   He admonishes you so that you may remember with concern  
Indeed Allah will admit those who believe and keep doing good deeds to the Gardens with streams flowing beneath them   Surely Allah does what He wills  
And surely Allah will distinguish those who have believed   with true hearts   and will certainly expose the hypocrites   too

And incline not towards those who are engaged in oppression   and exploitation   lest the Fire   of Hell   should touch down at you and there will be no protector for you apart from Allah   then help   too   will not be extended to you  
And they say   There is nothing   else   except our worldly life   We die and live here   only     And nothing kills us except   circumstances and occurrences of   time   i   e   they deny Allah and the Hereafter absolutely     And they simply do not have any knowledge of this   reality     They follow only their speculation and assumption

O our people   Accept the call of the Caller   the Holy Prophet Muhammad   blessings and peace be upon him     to Allah and believe in him   Allah will   then   forgive your sins and save you from a painful punishment

And do not do favour   to anyone with the purpose of   seeking more from him  
When he said to his father and his people   What do you worship  
And the entire mankind was one Umma     Community   in the beginning     Then they   differed among themselves and   disintegrated   And if it had not been decreed by your Lord   that the torment would not be hastened     the matters would have been settled between them in which they disagree  
And I am surely Most Forgiving to him who repents and affirms faith and behaves piously   then sticks to guidance   firmly    
Woe to the deniers on that Day  
And those who believe in the Revelations of their Lord  
And the mountains   after being reduced to dust   will be blown off   into the atmosphere     so they will be   eliminated like   a mirage

  The luxury   of the worldly life is nothing but play and funfair   and certainly it is the home of the Hereafter which is better for the Godfearing   Do you not understand   this reality    
In it there will be flowing springs  
Has the news reached you of the Calamity Overwhelming   everything    
We do not send down angels but with the   judgment of   Truth   i   e   We send them down to execute the torment when its time approaches   and they are not granted respite at that time  
The promise of Allah has drawn   near     so do not hasten in seeking it   Holy is He and exalted far above those objects which the disbelievers set up as   His   peers  
O Wives of the Messenger   You are not the like of any of the womenfolk   If you want to remain pious and Godfearing   then be not soft in your speech   while talking to men as and when required   lest someone whose heart is diseased   with hypocrisy   should feel inclined with desire   And   always   say words which are pure of any taint of doubt and flexibility

So he prayed to his Lord   I am powerless   before the transgressions of my people   so exact revenge  
And   the People of the Book   say   Become Jews or Christians   then you will be guided aright   Say     Nay   not so     the truth is that we have embraced the religion of Ibrahim   Abraham   who   far from every falsehood   had turned absolutely to Allah alone   And he was not of the polytheists  
So they rejected Shuaib and the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them   No doubt that was the torment of a terrible day  
  All   this   keeps happening   because Allah alone is the True   Creator and All   Sustaining   and doubtlessly He alone gives life to the dead and certainly He alone is All   Powerful to do everything  
So that we may follow   Din   Religion   of   the sorcerers if they overmaster   Musa   Moses   and Harun   Aaron
