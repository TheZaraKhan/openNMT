On observation of the life history of Mirza Ghalib and Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, one interesting co-incidence is exposed, like Delhi, the birth place of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was the residential town of Mirza Ghalib and Agra, the place of birth of Mirza Ghalib was the residential town of Syed Ahmed Khan for quite some time.
In these conditions, the chances of Syed Ahmed Khan meeting Ghalib in Delhi would have been rare, however, there are numerous evidences of literary exchanges between Ghalib and Syed Ahmed Khan which point to their mutual relationship.

The distancing in relations between the two contemporary intellectuals, caused by Ghalib's criticism on 'Ayen-e-Akbari' - a book compiled by Syed Ahmad Khan - in 1855 AD, was resolved when Mirza Ghalib stayed in the inn of Muradabad for some days while returning to Delhi from Rampur.

Except this for any multi directional contact's designer it is possible that can control the headers of HTTP of the sending by the server  according to its desire and like this when inter is not needed (for example news and business rise and fall pages ) then the collection of data can be saved so that every time coming on the page , the latest data collection will be displayed on serial order.
other than this if more connected like designer will also possible which was send by Mayel send HTTP can convert in to it's own language according to it's will like this different media which can safe Mawad from destruction to that when it can to paper it will show new contents every time

An expert archaeologist and his troops found some signs from the stone ages, but investigations into this claim could not be proved
An archaeological expert and his assistants claimed the found of some of the signs of stone age, however, later it didn't proved by research.
For example, it has been determined by the artifacts including sewing fabric, cultivation of rice, Shaman rituals and iron and bronze tools dug out through the archaeological digging about the Yayuae period (approximately 300 BC-250 AD), that this art has reached here through Chinese and Korean people. In fact, there is evidence that rice cultivation had started in 8000 BC (approximately?) in the surrounding regions of the famous Chinese river Yangtze, and reached the land of Japan in 1000 BC (approximately?).
For example year 250 to 300, Archeological survey's says that there was textile business crafts, Iron, Nickel etc.
For examples the artifacts from the 300 BC to 250 AD, which include clothe stiching, metal, bronze etc tell us that this came from the Chinese and Korean people. There is also proof that rice was sown around the Chinese river Yangzhi since 8000 BC and it reached Japan in 1000 BC
For example from 300 BC to 250 AD the signs found from ancient decades, cloth weaving, the cropping of paddy, great beliefs of worship, iron and bronze found from the period of Yayeevay has shown that this art has passed from Chinese and Koreans into Japan instead there are proofs of the fact that the cultivation of rice started in the nearby areas of the Yongus river in 8000 BC and reached to the land of Japanese in 1000 BC.

Normally, a simple mathematical procedure could be easily solved with the help of a calculator, but if the mathematical procedure involves large number of digits, then it requires a lot of time in order to solved by the calculator. For example, if a problem involves the addition of all the digits between 1 and 1000, then the calculator's buttons would have to be pressed more than 1000 times and more time would be required. But if a computer is provided with instructions to analyze this procedure only once, then it will store them inside itself and would be able to execute this mathematical procedure by utilizing these instructions the next time around, which would only take a few moments.
In General to make easy the calculation we use the calculator like wise to make easy the documentation sending the messages, saving the orders etc, can be done in computer.
Generally, if any simple calculation is needed, it can be easily done by the calculator , but if the calculation is related to long figures then if it is done by conventional method or by arithmetic then much more extra time is required , for example if summation of all the numbers between 1 and 1000 is needed then nearly one thousand times the button of addition is to be pressed, and time needed to do this will also be more but if the computer is instructed to do the task then it will store it inside its memory and for next time it will use it and can perform the arithmetic operation in few seconds only.
normally if there is some simple problem it can be done by calculator but if it is mathematical problem the it has to be done in some particular way so that requires more time, for example you have to add from 1 to 1000 then you have to press all buttons and more time is require but if you give all these instruction to the shumarinda one time so from next time it will do it self automatically which requires only seconds

The basis of Hitler's popularity was his party's ideology. Later on, due to this very ideology, not only Germany was split into two but Hitler was also ranked among the worst personalities of human history. Even today, Hitler's name is considered as much of a curse among the western nations as the name of Yazid is among the Muslims. After Hitler's death in 1945, perhaps no mother ever named her child as such.
Hitler popularity was because of the theory of there party and with this Germany divided into two parts and also in history hitler become a most disgrace person , as in Muslim yazid word is like a shit in western nation hitler is considered as a shit , after the end of hitler in 1945 in think no mother has become a name as Hitler
On the being the imported personality party was giving him a special category and this resulted to divide the Germany in 2 parts.

The both sir seyyad ahamad khan and Galib could make a proper friendship but they were living the same part of Delhi.
due to a big age difference about 20 years ,a mutual friendship could not be created between Mirza Ghalib and Syed Ahmed Khan however the yearly settlement of both  contemporaneous in  Delhi Durbar is the main reason of their Acquaintance and Vicinity.
Because of this age difference of about 20 years between Mirza Ghalib and Syed Ahmed Khan, they were not able to maintain good friendship but the long co-existence of both of them in the same place,Delhi had definitely brought them together to a very close acquaintance.
Ghalib's this letter and its reference to Syed Ahmed Khan reveals the their correspondence. It also comes to fore that along with this letter Ghalib sent a copy of one of his Naat (a poem in praise of the prophet) to Syed Ahmed Khan
Ghalib this letter and the reference to this books and it also shows the relation between books with this letter it also shows that ghalib sent his natai masnoi with this letter to saeed ahmed khan
this letter of galib and in this the reference of syed ahmed khans book proves the written  relation also between them and it is known with this letter that he sent his poetry also to syed ahmed khan

While all these organs of the state are creatures created and bound by law,
according to Aina e Akbari the opposing of Ghalib iswas right according to this Ghalib before this incident have alredy written the book on the government of Mughals

In our view Ghalib's unpleasant comments on Aain e Akbari  can be proved unjust by the fact that Ghalib himself has written a topic on Mughal kingdom  some years before this unpleasant happening.
according to aaine akberi the against of galib is some thing clear near to us that before this incident galib wrote the history of mogul titled mahar neem roz
Islamic genealogies correctly state that Nimrod was the son of Cush, but incorrectly state that he lived
